	      <h2 style="color:aqua;text-shadow:2px 2px red;font-size:18px;font-weight: normal;">GAMEPLAY AND SYNOPSIS</h2>
	      <p>DEC is a standard 6 Stage + Extra game with four base difficulties. Yet at the same time, it is so much more.</p>
	      <p>In DEC, you play as either Flamon or Strabimon. The duo are entering a tourney and battling against some of the denizens of the Digital World. However, as they travel through forests, mountains, and beyond, they uncover the truth behind the tourney, and meet some new friends.</p>
	      <p>DEC plays like a standard Touhou-esque game. It is a vertical 2D shmup featuring bombs (and deathbombs), replay and continue functionality, and more.</p>
	      <p>The main gimmick involves collecting DigiEnergy via grazing or by special items, which allows Flamon and Strabimon to Digivolve up to two stages, upgrading their attacks in the process. They each have their own strengths and advantages, and the Stage 4 boss changes depending on which character you choose (as is typical in earlier Touhou-esque games). The game also includes ExAttack Practice, which allows you to practice some of the attacks used by the various bosses. More information on the game can be found in the ReadMe_DEC.rtf file.</p>
	      <p>Additionally, there is an in-game manual that explains some basic commands.</p>
	      <h2 style="color:aqua;text-shadow:2px 2px red;font-size:18px;font-weight: normal;">ADDITIONAL NOTES</h2>
	      <p>DEC is a game of beautiful (although sometimes very hard) danmaku, challenge, and hopefully, fun. All music is from official Digimon sources, as I was unable to get original music, but in the end, it gives the characters more depth and personality than my poor attempt at dialogue ever could.</p>
	      <p>Digital Earth: Conquest was my first major Danmakufu ph3 project. Freed of the restrictions of 0.12m, I was able to go full force on literally everything, resulting in a game full of gorgeous (though simple) 3D backgrounds, plenty of amazing spellcards, and more.</p>
	      <p>There were many times I when wanted to give up on this game, but I am glad I didn't, and it's amazing to see how far I have come.</p>
	      <h2 style="color:aqua;text-shadow:2px 2px red;font-size:18px;font-weight: normal;">LEGAL AND CREDITS</h2>
	      <p>Digimon is owned by Digimon (the company). Various resources in this game are not original - music comes from the Digimon Anime, Games, etc. All credits can be found in the game's credits roll, and general disclaimers can be found in the script/Digital Earth Conquest/ Credits.rtf file.</p>
