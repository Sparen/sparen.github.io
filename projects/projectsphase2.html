	      <p>This was a radical departure from my Sanae boss battle in that originality was almost completely replaced by a burning desire to be a recreation of the original with an original twist. I think I did a better job of recreating the spell and 3D backgrounds and danmaku than anything else though. In the end, it wasn't particularly scary and the gimmicks were not particularly enjoyable. However, this is by no means a bad script. Release post <a target="_blank" href="https://www.shrinemaiden.org/forum/index.php/topic,13738.msg1036293.html#msg1036293">here</a>.</p>

	      <p>My RaNGE 10 Sanae entry is undoubtedly the best script I ever made in Touhou Danmakufu 0.12m. It holds a number of distinguishing factors - one being my first script with a fully functional 3D background, another being my most original 0.12m script, and a final one being the start of my DNHArt playlist. Release post <a target="_blank" href="https://www.shrinemaiden.org/forum/index.php/topic,13738.msg1015611.html#msg1015611"> here</a>. This entry won third place in the contest (technically fourth since there were two entries tied for first).</p>
	      <p>Fun fact: This is the video I showed off during my MIT interview. I was later rejected, but that doesn't really matter - this is me at my best and no matter how painful the development process was, the end result was worth it - pretty good danmaku, relatively balanced difficulty, and a beautiful 3D background rendered using my own skill.</p>
	      <h2 style="color:thistle">Kyllallrenn Player Script</h2>	      <p>Release Date: May 31, 2013</p>
	      <p>This project was an attempt at a new player script. However, it saw almost no use and was eventually removed from Bulletforge. Arguably one of the least used player scripts I have made.</p>	      <h2 style="color:aqua">LOCAA Contest 3: Suicune Boss Battle</h2>	      <p>Release Date: May 31, 2013</p>

	      <p>This contest entry marked the start of my time in the Land of Codes and Apertures and marked a new era in my danmaku abilities - coinciding with around PDD Stage 2, it determined the fate of PDD's Extra Stage and also became my first ever contest entry for a Danmakufu contest. It happened to coincide with my newfound obsession with polar and parametric equations as well, hence the theme. The first spell of this script has come to be one of the distinguishing factors for my Danmakufu career.</p>	      <br>            </div>          </div>        </div>      </div>      <footer>        <p style="text-align: center;"><a href="#top">Top</a></p>        <p style="text-align: center;">Copyright Â© 2014-2015 by Andrew Fan</p>        <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Other            Sites/Affiliates</span></p>        <div style="text-align: center;">          <a target="_blank" href="http://www.shrinemaiden.org/forum/index.php"><img	      alt="&quot;Maidens of the Kaleidoscope&quot;"	      src="../images/afflogomotk.png"></a>          <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bulletforge.org"><img alt="&quot;Bulletforge&quot;"	      src="../images/afflogobulletforge.png"></a>        </div>      </footer>    </div>  </body></html>
