Spells: Worth 20 points each. If has multiple phases, each phase counts as 10 points.

Stages: Worth 5 points per phase (determined by self)

Backgrounds, music, sound and effects: Counted as part of "Theme and Experience"
Organization and Ease of Use: Counted as part of "Other".

My Player: A2 Marisa

Difficulty: Default

Nonspell 1: I love the way the bubbles have the rings of notes around them. It adds a unique touch, 
	especially since the notes change color and are a meaningful part of the attack. The transition 
	from black is a little meh though. [8/10]
Spell 1: A nice idea and overall well-executed. However, that last red phase can get very hairy, and may 
	border on unfair at the very end of the wave. [16/20]
Nonspell 2: First wave looks crazy but is pretty nice, and the second wave brings back the nonspell theme 
	in a different and satisfying way. [9/10]
Spell 2: Looks cool, plays cool, but can get a little hard. Also, most of the notes are not spell resist, 
	so bombing or dying leaves only the core of the notes. [17/20]
Nonspell 3: Unfortunately, leaves something to be desired. The red bullets are meh, the transition from 
	black to gray on a gray background is questionable, even if it looks cool, and having only one laser 
	is like... whelp. Underwhelming. [7/10]
Spell 3: Super dense and obviously doesn't feel original. Can get hairy. Also, are your note bullet hitbox 
	rects correct? [15/20]
Spell 4: It's not always clear which lasers spawn fireballs and which don't, and it's very easy to get hit 
	by a fireball when a laser disappears. Also, you can't always tell which end of the laser the 
	fireballs spawn from. Near the end, it can completely wall you as well with lasers coming from 
	anywhere and spawning fireballs. A nice survival, but has some things that need to be addressed. 
	[16/20]
Spell 5: Simply put, a cluster____. Each phase brings nothing new to the table, and the transition from 
	black to color on that background so close to the player makes dodging very hard. Also, if the 
	player decides to shotgun the boss and blast it at point blank range, since the orbs trigger based 
	on distance to player, the entire attack becomes super easy, and super boring. Boss is not 
	bomb-immune, and the bullets aren't either, further simplifying the process. Not memorable in the 
	slightest. [12/20]

Comments
-Spell background blue sprites are heavily blurred. It may be better to try and find better quality images, 
	because the blurriness detracts from the experience.
-Undeleted object errors after survival spell. Make sure your lasers are deleting COMPLETELY before the 
	next attack starts.</pre>

My Player: A2 Marisa

Difficulty: Normal

Stage Phase 1: Stage opener is decent enough. Can be a little lethal to first time players though. [4/5]
Stage Phase 2: I don't particularly like the laser enemies. They're not bad, but they're hard to hit.
	You may want to consider making it easier to move around the screen by making the angle offset 
	of the yellow lasers bigger each frame. [3/5]
Stage Phase 3: At first, the orange bullets are fine, but the timing of them exploding into walls and the 
	giant arrows coming down is not great. It's very easy to get slammed into a wall or a bullet.
	After this there are more lasers. Meh. [3/5]

Midboss Nonspell: True to her nature, Doremy is hard. It's a good attack, with interesting use of the
	pattern and graphics. However... it might be a little *too* hard for Normal. [8/10]
Midboss Spell: If the player does as much as move a tiny bit at the start of the spell, all hell breaks 
	loose. You definitely want the first wave around Doremy, and then the second wave around the player 
	or something similar. It's a good attack, but very unfair to first-time players. Also, some usage 
	of colors would add a lot to this attack. [17/20]

Stage Phase 4: A well-done and well-paced stage portion, with good usage of streaming portions, aimed 
	portions, and other various techniques. I'm also glad to see the red laser enemies adding value to 
	the danmaku. [5/5]
Stage Phase 5: This time the orbs are blasting stuff from the bottom left and right of the screen at a
	rather fast speed if you don't take them out in time. Not particularly great. [3/5]
Stage Phase 6: Not bad, but quickly gets repetitive. Also, the bullets are the same color as the flicker,
	so it can be hard to tell when and where the bullets first spawn, easily cheapshotting. [4/5]

Boss Nonspell 1: The attack is solid, but the warping (especially when he warps only a few pixels) looks
	terrible due to all of the baggage he's carrying. [8/10]
Boss Spell 1: Nice multiphase attack. Second wave's second set of lasers can be painful though, and the
	third wave's flames from the bottom can be quite fast, especially if the player has been at the 
	bottom of the screen. Also, the sudden acceleration with angle change of the blue stars greatly
	increases the overall difficulty of that third wave, when you are forced to move up. But overall,
	this is a well-designed and interesting spell. [19/20]
Boss Nonspell 2: Chaos appears out of nowhere. The spawn speed of the curvy lasers and the amount of the
	screen they immediately cover within less than a second is far too large. Then you have the 
	subtract bullets that blend in with the background and accelerate quite quickly. Not a nonspell 
	for the faint of heart, though it's a good attack. Just needs some adjustments. [8/10]
Boss Spell 2: Blue subtract bullets are once again very hard to see, especially the lasers. If the lasers 
	allowed for some more adjustment time or were easier to see, this would be a fine attack. [16/20]
Boss Nonspell 3: Curving shiny black stuff comes at you. The first yellow wave is in my opinion way too fast
	and way too dense. The curving of the first two waves are very hard to dodge effectively. But 
	overall, it's not a bad attack. [07/10]
Boss Spell 3: Though the blue bullets can be a royal pain to see on top of all of the other effects and the
	blue background, this spell is just pure amazing. You took a very good idea and executed it 
	wonderfully. If only you could see those blue bullets better... [18/20]
Boss Spell 4: Apart from being unable to see the black bullets well over the lasers if you are at the 
	bottom of the screen... this is a thoughtful and well-executed spell whose main weakness is the 
	usage of all black. Some lasers blend in exactly with the background grid as well. Also, the walls 
	from the top and bottom can be quite deadly, as they become fast very quickly. [17/20]

Comments
-Pause menu sound effects completely overpower the bgm (and all other sound effects)
-Overall, the biggest problem was not being able to see bullets well. Please work on that.</pre>

My Player: Rin

Difficulty: Normal

Stage Phase 1: Opening danmaku is all decent enough. Each wave has its own self-contained danmaku, and 
	all of it is pretty decent, though not particularly outstanding. [3/5]
Stage Phase 2: Simply put, this phase is a mess, with the Roggenrola just spamming one attack at you. Not 
	particularly interesting or fun. [2/5]

Midboss Nonspell: In-character, feels appropriate. Good difficulty-wise, and overall a pretty decent 
	nonspell. [8/10]
Midboss Spell: A very nice in-character and interesting spell. I liked the danmaku and aesthetic choices
	made here. [19/20]

Stage Phase 3: A rather nice phase, though the Solosis are quite boring. The Mr. Mime can wall a little 
	bit, but it's done well. [4/5]
Stage Phase 4: Comes well together but feels very disjoint like the other parts of the stage. [4/5]
Stage Phase 5: Unfortunately, the Sableye's bullets are too dense and are too hard to see on the 
	background. It's rather hard to make it through the bullets due to that sight issue. [2/5] 

Boss Nonspell 1: Beautiful, well-designed, but rather dull to dodge due to the speed. [8/10]
Boss Spell 1: Can get very chaotic, and the aimed bullets blend in with the lasers a little too much. I 
	also don't get the attack at all, but w/e. [16/20]
Boss Nonspell 2: Another nice nonspell, but the angles can be lethal. [8/10]
Boss Spell 2: Since the bouncing is the issue here, this spell is either super easy or downright murderous.
	If you are on the other side of the screen from the sphere, it's a cakewalk, but the sphere can't 
	be dodged easily if it goes at you. The explosion is, simply put, disappointing. [13/20]
Boss Nonspell 3: Another pretty attack like the first nonspell, but more chaotic. [8/10]
Boss Spell 3: The idea is good and it looks pretty and original, but it plays absolutely horribly. The 
	entire spell consists of going from corner to corner, and not being able to hit the boss with your 
	shots is honestly a pain. The spikes are so long that it's nearly impossible to stay under the boss 
	for any amount of time, especially since Diancie accelerates at the player. Not to mention that the 
	red bullets are not fun to dodge at all and are more of an annoyance than anything else. Thankfully, 
	it's possible to time a bomb so that you can hit the boss. Otherwise I'd give this attack an even 
	lower score than I already have. Oh, and there are lasers remaining after the attack. Bugs! [6/20]
Boss Nonspell 4: Not a bad attack - certainly better than the last one. But not super amazing either. Feels
	unmistakably average. [8/10]
Boss Spell 4: Looks nice, that's for sure. But gameplay wise it's not super amazing. Orin is too slow to
	move at the speeds this attack imposes. [13/20]
Boss Nonspell 5: Feels like something I've played before. Feels like a step down from the previous 
	nonspell. Overall, not too amazing... And then there are (0,0) spawning errors. :( [7/10]
Boss Spell 5: This attack is really nice to look at. It's overall not super amazing, but it's not bad 
	either. A solid final spell. [16/20]
