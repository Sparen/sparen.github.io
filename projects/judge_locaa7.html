My Player: A2 Marisa

Difficulty: Default

Nonspell 1: I love the way the bubbles have the rings of notes around them. It adds a unique touch, 
	especially since the notes change color and are a meaningful part of the attack. The transition 
	from black is a little meh though. [8/10]
Spell 1: A nice idea and overall well-executed. However, that last red phase can get very hairy, and may 
	border on unfair at the very end of the wave. [16/20]
Nonspell 2: First wave looks crazy but is pretty nice, and the second wave brings back the nonspell theme 
	in a different and satisfying way. [9/10]
Spell 2: Looks cool, plays cool, but can get a little hard. Also, most of the notes are not spell resist, 
	so bombing or dying leaves only the core of the notes. [17/20]
Nonspell 3: Unfortunately, leaves something to be desired. The red bullets are meh, the transition from 
	black to gray on a gray background is questionable, even if it looks cool, and having only one laser 
	is like... whelp. Underwhelming. [7/10]
Spell 3: Super dense and obviously doesn't feel original. Can get hairy. Also, are your note bullet hitbox 
	rects correct? [15/20]
Spell 4: It's not always clear which lasers spawn fireballs and which don't, and it's very easy to get hit 
	by a fireball when a laser disappears. Also, you can't always tell which end of the laser the 
	fireballs spawn from. Near the end, it can completely wall you as well with lasers coming from 
	anywhere and spawning fireballs. A nice survival, but has some things that need to be addressed. 
	[16/20]
Spell 5: Simply put, a cluster____. Each phase brings nothing new to the table, and the transition from 
	black to color on that background so close to the player makes dodging very hard. Also, if the 
	player decides to shotgun the boss and blast it at point blank range, since the orbs trigger based 
	on distance to player, the entire attack becomes super easy, and super boring. Boss is not 
	bomb-immune, and the bullets aren't either, further simplifying the process. Not memorable in the 
	slightest. [12/20]

Comments
-Spell background blue sprites are heavily blurred. It may be better to try and find better quality images, 
	because the blurriness detracts from the experience.
-Undeleted object errors after survival spell. Make sure your lasers are deleting COMPLETELY before the 
	next attack starts.</pre>

My Player: A2 Marisa

Difficulty: Normal

Stage Phase 1: Stage opener is decent enough. Can be a little lethal to first time players though. [4/5]
Stage Phase 2: I don't particularly like the laser enemies. They're not bad, but they're hard to hit.
	You may want to consider making it easier to move around the screen by making the angle offset 
	of the yellow lasers bigger each frame. [3/5]
Stage Phase 3: At first, the orange bullets are fine, but the timing of them exploding into walls and the 
	giant arrows coming down is not great. It's very easy to get slammed into a wall or a bullet.
	After this there are more lasers. Meh. [3/5]

Midboss Nonspell: True to her nature, Doremy is hard. It's a good attack, with interesting use of the
	pattern and graphics. However... it might be a little *too* hard for Normal. [8/10]
Midboss Spell: If the player does as much as move a tiny bit at the start of the spell, all hell breaks 
	loose. You definitely want the first wave around Doremy, and then the second wave around the player 
	or something similar. It's a good attack, but very unfair to first-time players. Also, some usage 
	of colors would add a lot to this attack. [17/20]

Stage Phase 4: A well-done and well-paced stage portion, with good usage of streaming portions, aimed 
	portions, and other various techniques. I'm also glad to see the red laser enemies adding value to 
	the danmaku. [5/5]
Stage Phase 5: This time the orbs are blasting stuff from the bottom left and right of the screen at a
	rather fast speed if you don't take them out in time. Not particularly great. [3/5]
Stage Phase 6: Not bad, but quickly gets repetitive. Also, the bullets are the same color as the flicker,
	so it can be hard to tell when and where the bullets first spawn, easily cheapshotting. [4/5]

Boss Nonspell 1: The attack is solid, but the warping (especially when he warps only a few pixels) looks
	terrible due to all of the baggage he's carrying. [8/10]
Boss Spell 1: Nice multiphase attack. Second wave's second set of lasers can be painful though, and the
	third wave's flames from the bottom can be quite fast, especially if the player has been at the 
	bottom of the screen. Also, the sudden acceleration with angle change of the blue stars greatly
	increases the overall difficulty of that third wave, when you are forced to move up. But overall,
	this is a well-designed and interesting spell. [19/20]
Boss Nonspell 2: Chaos appears out of nowhere. The spawn speed of the curvy lasers and the amount of the
	screen they immediately cover within less than a second is far too large. Then you have the 
	subtract bullets that blend in with the background and accelerate quite quickly. Not a nonspell 
	for the faint of heart, though it's a good attack. Just needs some adjustments. [8/10]
Boss Spell 2: Blue subtract bullets are once again very hard to see, especially the lasers. If the lasers 
	allowed for some more adjustment time or were easier to see, this would be a fine attack. [16/20]
Boss Nonspell 3: Curving shiny black stuff comes at you. The first yellow wave is in my opinion way too fast
	and way too dense. The curving of the first two waves are very hard to dodge effectively. But 
	overall, it's not a bad attack. [07/10]
Boss Spell 3: Though the blue bullets can be a royal pain to see on top of all of the other effects and the
	blue background, this spell is just pure amazing. You took a very good idea and executed it 
	wonderfully. If only you could see those blue bullets better... [18/20]
Boss Spell 4: Apart from being unable to see the black bullets well over the lasers if you are at the 
	bottom of the screen... this is a thoughtful and well-executed spell whose main weakness is the 
	usage of all black. Some lasers blend in exactly with the background grid as well. Also, the walls 
	from the top and bottom can be quite deadly, as they become fast very quickly. [17/20]

My Player: Rin

Difficulty: Normal

Stage Phase 1: Opening danmaku is all decent enough. Each wave has its own self-contained danmaku, and 
	all of it is pretty decent, though not particularly outstanding. [3/5]
Stage Phase 2: Simply put, this phase is a mess, with the Roggenrola just spamming one attack at you. Not 
	particularly interesting or fun. [2/5]

Midboss Nonspell: In-character, feels appropriate. Good difficulty-wise, and overall a pretty decent 
	nonspell. [8/10]
Midboss Spell: A very nice in-character and interesting spell. I liked the danmaku and aesthetic choices
	made here. [19/20]

Stage Phase 3: A rather nice phase, though the Solosis are quite boring. The Mr. Mime can wall a little 
	bit, but it's done well. [4/5]
Stage Phase 4: Comes well together but feels very disjoint like the other parts of the stage. [4/5]
Stage Phase 5: Unfortunately, the Sableye's bullets are too dense and are too hard to see on the 
	background. It's rather hard to make it through the bullets due to that sight issue. [2/5] 

Boss Nonspell 1: Beautiful, well-designed, but rather dull to dodge due to the speed. [8/10]
Boss Spell 1: Can get very chaotic, and the aimed bullets blend in with the lasers a little too much. I 
	also don't get the attack at all, but w/e. [16/20]
Boss Nonspell 2: Another nice nonspell, but the angles can be lethal. [8/10]
Boss Spell 2: Since the bouncing is the issue here, this spell is either super easy or downright murderous.
	If you are on the other side of the screen from the sphere, it's a cakewalk, but the sphere can't 
	be dodged easily if it goes at you. The explosion is, simply put, disappointing. [13/20]
Boss Nonspell 3: Another pretty attack like the first nonspell, but more chaotic. [8/10]
Boss Spell 3: The idea is good and it looks pretty and original, but it plays absolutely horribly. The 
	entire spell consists of going from corner to corner, and not being able to hit the boss with your 
	shots is honestly a pain. The spikes are so long that it's nearly impossible to stay under the boss 
	for any amount of time, especially since Diancie accelerates at the player. Not to mention that the 
	red bullets are not fun to dodge at all and are more of an annoyance than anything else. Thankfully, 
	it's possible to time a bomb so that you can hit the boss. Otherwise I'd give this attack an even 
	lower score than I already have. Oh, and there are lasers remaining after the attack. Bugs! [6/20]
Boss Nonspell 4: Not a bad attack - certainly better than the last one. But not super amazing either. Feels
	unmistakably average. [8/10]
Boss Spell 4: Looks nice, that's for sure. But gameplay wise it's not super amazing. Orin is too slow to
	move at the speeds this attack imposes. [13/20]
Boss Nonspell 5: Feels like something I've played before. Feels like a step down from the previous 
	nonspell. Overall, not too amazing... And then there are (0,0) spawning errors. :( [7/10]
Boss Spell 5: This attack is really nice to look at. It's overall not super amazing, but it's not bad 
	either. A solid final spell. [16/20]

My Player: SanaeB, ReimuA

Difficulty: Easy

Stage Phase 1: Enemies blend in with background, bullets spawn immediately without any warning. Also, 
	ReimuA is completely incapable of defeating most of them. [2/5]
Stage Phase 2: SA enemies are OK. Nothing interesting here until the yellow bullets appear. The entire 
	thing overall is boring and uninteresting. [2/5]

Midboss Nonspell: Overall not bad. The bullet patterns themselves are quite decent, but the wall forces 
	the player to dodge within the mess of bullets. This can feel quite unfair because the walls are 
	dense. Otherwise, not that bad. [7/10]
Midboss Spell: Exceptionally slow-moving, boring, and otherwise dull. The speed of the fast bullets makes
	the attack feel unbalanced just because of the sheer contrast. [14/20]

Stage Phase 3: The sheer boredom caused by three BoWaP death fairies in a row is indescribable. [1/5]

Boss Nonspell 1: Decent, but unremarkable. Fairer but far less interesting than the midboss spell. Also 
	gets extremely repetitive since there is little to no variety. [6/10]
Boss Spell 1: This spell is quite nice, with the multiple components of the spell working together in 
	tandem. I appreciate what you did here, with the difficulty fair and the danmaku interesting to 
	dodge. [18/20]
Boss Nonspell 2: Like Nonspell 1 but equally unremarkable. [6/10]
Boss Spell 2: A spell that forces misdirection. Not amazing, and if you're not misdirecting, it's really 
	not fair to dodge. Leaves my mouth with an overall feeling of 'meh' [15/20]
Boss Nonspell 3: Exceptionally unremarkable - you just sit there and occasionally move a little bit. Not 
	fun or interesting at all. [4/10]
Boss Spell 3: A very cool idea with very nice execution. My only problem with it is that the radius for 
	bullets turning yellow and disappearing is so small - it's not intuitive that the spell even has 
	such a feature. Otherwise a solid spell. [17/20]
Boss Spell 4: For a survival, this is exceptionally dull and uninteresting, with almost no variation and 
	no effort required by the player. Nothing ever changes, and that makes the experience fall very 
	flat. That said, it's also not really worth much of anything since you just sit there. [8/20]
Boss Spell 5: Feels like Nono's script. A solid spell but nothing especially interesting to note. The 
	second phase brings some new stuff to the table, but it doesn't change the overall average feel 
	of the attack. [16/20]

My Player: A2 Marisa

Difficulty: Normal

Stage Phase 1: Opener has been greatly improved, but the stage title is still a little hard to see with 
	the blue background. [2/5]
Stage Phase 2: Lots of bullets, enemies swerving from side to side. Problem is that they continue spawning
	when they get to the bottom of the screen. Very chaotic, lots of bullets coming from the bottom of
	the screen. [2/5]
Stage Phase 3: I highly advise against that red enemy that flies offscreen, then flies back on the screen
	aiming at the player. It's quite cheap, even if it's easy enough to misdirect afterwards. [1/5]
Stage Phase 4: And another red enemy comes out with some friends. And then there are some more, and even
	if you can see it coming, they come so fast that you can't get away. :( [0/5]

Nonspell 1: Pretty standard, with the spread and small walls. But having all the bullets suddenly stop 
	and move upwards is very cheap. [4/10]
Spell 1: I like the way the bullets are spawned. The boss's movements work well. In fact, the green bullets
	feel like they don't belong, even though they're pulling the entire thing together with their colors
	and trajectories. But then the bullets suddenly move upwards again... [15/20]
Nonspell 2: Unfortunately, I'm not a fan of having the boss home on the player along with bullets spawning 
	randomly anywhere in the top half of the screen. In this case, the bullets moving upwards is less
	problematic because the boss charges, but it's best to charge first and THEN change the bullet 
	trajectories. [5/10]
Spell 2: This spell has an enormous potential to wall the player with fast, semi-visible (blinking) bullets.
	Since the bullets alternate, it's very hard to tell how large the clumps are. There's also the 
	general problem of bullets spawning from various places on the screen at high speeds - when the
	player is surrounded by these, it doesn't matter whether or not the player knows where the spawn
	points are - it's not really that fair to the player with those speeds. To be fair though, the 
	explosions actually spawn statically, so it's not random angles. [14/20]
Nonspell 3: This is how you should have been handling the bullets moving upwards. My only gripe here is how
	some bullets are outside of the playing field but have not been deleted, so bullets come from below
	the playing field. Other than that, this attack is definitely the fairest of the nonspells so far.
	Unfortunately though, it's still just about average. [7/10]
Spell 3: This could have been a good idea. But danmaku is about dodging, and taking control away from the
	player at this extent is no longer considered fair to the player. Out of respect for those who play
	this script in the future, I unfortunately cannot give you any points for this attack, despite the
	fact that it's not so bad if the player gets thrown around at a more controllable speed and with 
	more warning. [0/20]
Spell 4: For better or for worse, this is one of the best spells in the script. It's relatively fair, it's
	dynamic, and it puts together some of the previously shown abilities. But it's still too dense, 
	even on Normal. [16/20]

My Player: Marisa

Difficulty: Easyish

Nonspell 1: Obvious gimmick, great to dodge. Simple yet highly effective, and provides an interesting and
	unique aesthetic. I approve. [9/10]
Spell 1: I like the approach you took at showing how the spell works, and the danmaku itself works well, 
	with the crossing bullets and bullets in the central part of the screen working together to give
	the player a challenging time. Excellently designed, great to dodge. [19/20]
Nonspell 2: Well-designed, and although basically the same as the first nonspell, the orientation of the 
	bullets provides a completely different yet wonderful experience. Excellent job here. [10/10]
Spell 2: I love this spell but just don't understand what is causing the explosions in the upper right and 
	left of the playing field... Except that I get that the rightmost bubble of one wave and the 
	leftmost bubble of the next wave explode, after watching it for a little while. But it's not exactly
	what I would call intuitive. But still, a nice spell that's interesting to dodge and plays well
	overall. [18/20]
Spell 3: *FOAMING* This spell is wonderful - it's creative and super fun to dodge, but I have to take off
	some points due to hitboxes and the speed at which the bullets eventually move. [18/20]
Spell 4: And this is where it all breaks down. The gimmick of resetting the counter is cruel - the kind of
	thing that only exists in troll scripts, and there is no way to get around this. Also, the danmaku
	in the first wave reminds me heavily of Raiko. The second phase just fires massive walls at you 
	that make the giant moon more likely to catch you. Thankfully, the timer doesn't completely reset
	since it goes back to the start of the most recent phase, but... still. Not super cool, though it's
	definitely a good spell in some aspects. [12/20]

-Marisa's bomb makes me squeal in delight. I LOVE HOW IT LOOKS.
-Main menu is confusing as heck. You need to show the player that other options exist.
-1UPs in a script with infinite lives? o_O</pre>

My Player: Sanae

Difficulty: Normal

Nonspell 1: Standard nonspell, like the hexagons. Nothing special though. Average. [8/10]
Spell 1: I like this spell quite a bit - the way the laser illuminatis work is quite effective
	and it's quite a solid attack, especially with the multiple phases. [18/20]
Nonspell 2: Once again, you have a two-element nonspell where the elements work well together. However, 
	compared to last time, I think that it feels a little too easy. [8/10]
Spell 2: This is definitely interesting I like how the knives move - it's also quite fun to dodge. However,
	it gets repetitive quite quickly... until the black out. At this point, the knives closing in feel
	exceptionally cheap, because there's no time to react. If there was some kind of warning in sound,
	that would make it much fairer, but since if you're even half a second late you will get trapped, 
	I can't give this spell as many points as I would like to. [15/20]
Nonspell 3: This nonspell is interesting in its phases and parts, and I like how well it plays. Nice attack,
	and all of the components work together quite well. [9/10]
Spell 3: Dynamic, and gets the player moving. A solid spell, though the bullets aren't quite exactly on
	the lasers. [17/20]
Spell 4: If we're supposed to be able to hear the voice, it's not possible over the music and sound effects.
	As a spell, it's... loud. Also, it's not interesting to dodge or look at in the slightest. Feels 
	below average in danmaku quality and experience. [14/20]

Comments
-Splash screen and main menu have a lot of text that is not possible to read on the background.
-Please use .ogg for music instead of .mp3
-In the dialogue, you need to make sure when pausing, the music is also paused
-Unfortunately, forcing us to sit through all of that text is not exactly the best experience. If you're 
	going to advertise for this guy, do it in the description of your project or somewhere in your 
	package. Also, some people may not like the word choices used. And the voice isn't even synced to 
	the dialogue.</pre>

My Player: Sanae, Sakuya

Difficulty: Normal

Nonspell 1: Super generic on the level of a new scripter's first ever attack. Definitely matches up with
	the aesthetic but is completely uninteresting from a danmaku player perspective. [5/10]
Spell 1: A super boring and repetitive rainbow attack. Unfortunately, the music loops too. So it's just an
	endless wave of the same thing in your eyes and your ears. Not bad, but not worth much. [14/20]
Nonspell 2: A superfast wave of bullets comes at you, and before it's gone, the next one has arrived. It's
	actually quite a decent nonspell - the various components all work together quite nicely. But it's
	still quite underwhelming. [8/10]
Spell 2: Very fast, very shiny, very loud and flashy. I approve. But very repetitive. [16/20]
Nonspell 3: Like the first non, but less generic. Reminds me of Konngara. Not bad, works quite effectively.
	[8/10]
Spell 3: Very fast, huge difficulty spike, threatens to shove player against the wall will all of the 
	brofists and yellow bullets. Has potential to be a good spell, but doesn't work so well. Still, it 
	definitely fits in with the theme. [15/20]

Comments
-I have no idea how the aesthetic is supposed to match up with the character at all... There's absolutely 
	no respect for the character being portrayed.
-If I were judging based off of script unity, you did an amazing job with a unified theme. But that's not
	part of the judging criteria.</pre>

My Player: Sanae

Difficulty: Extra

Nonspell 1: Starts out pretty nice, though the bubbles should probably be ADD blended. But it's quite a 
	nice attack with danmaku components that work very nicely together. Nice job. [9/10]
Spell 1: The base pattern is quite good, though I'd advise against such a dark blue and red for the 
	arrowhead bullets. Also, although the homing shot is nice, I think that it can make the spell a 
	little too difficult. They hone in too many times, in my opinion, and that forces the player 
	upwards into the mess. Quite a nice spell though. [16/20]
Nonspell 2: Nice attack here! The two parts work very nicely together. The difficulty is appropriate, 
	and the attack is quite nice as well. Once again, ALPHA orbs look a little out of place. [9/10]
Spell 2: I love how you warn the player of the danger below as well as provide a clear line for when the
	explosions will occur. Each component works well, as well as the quick increases in firing speed
	before resetting. The spell as a whole is excellently designed, and is a very good attack from a
	player perspective as well. Excellent job here. [20/20]
Nonspell 3: I absolutely love this nonspell - the colors, graphics, and danmaku all work especially well.
	I like the coins as well - they add a touch of color and so much more with the way their spawning
	patterns enhance the other components of the attack. Fantastic! [10/10]
Spell 3: I love the way you use the gravity and forces here! However, some of the bullet speeds can get a
	little out of control. The idea is great though, and if the transitions were slightly less severe, 
	it would be amazing. Super fun to dodge though. [17/20]
Nonspell 4: Another nice nonspell, though some of the bullets spawn too close to the player for comfort.
	Also, the kunai can form walls. [8/10]
Nonspell 5: Definitely keeps you on your toes, this one! While quite good, it could use some graphic 
	variety or color - it's just a lot of mist and gray. Also, repetitive. [7/10]
Spell 4 Phase 1: Ah, the survival. The first part can get hairy with the Junko-style bullets flying off 
	of the player's location. Also, it moves a little too fast. [8/10]
Spell 4 Phase 2: The second phase is cool, but the arrowhead bullets, as with the first spell, are just 
	too dark colored. Also, the blue bullets sometimes line up and block the gaps in between the red 
	bullet waves. Might want bigger gaps between the blue bullets, in my opinion. [8/10]
Spell 4 Phase 3: Unfortunately, the third phase just seems like a mess with bullets flying everywhere.
	It's not as fun or interesting as the previous two phases and has that Nonspell 5 color issue 
	where all of the bullets you dodge are just white. Also, worst of all, if you happen to be in
	the center of the screen when the spell terminates, you get an instal-kill because the boss's 
	hitbox reactivates too quickly. [4/10]
Spell 5 Phase 1: Love the organized chaos, don't love the ALPHA rendered orange bullets. Sort of ugly. 
	But as a whole, I like this attack. [8/10]
Spell 5 Phase 2: Significantly easier than the previous phase, but the colors feel dull to me. The 
	pattern is rather decent but nothing too spectacular. [7/10]
Spell 5 Phase 3: Love the shape formed by the bubbles, and love the attack as a whole. The bullets form 
	lines that sort of collapse in on each other but not quite, which is a nice touch. But the bubbles 
	need ADD rendering, and it can get really hectic with things exploding on the edges of the screen. 
	[7/10]
