              <p>Welcome to my DevLog for my collaboration project with FrenticPony!</p>
              <h2 style="color:rgb(59,248,80)">What is this Project?</h2>
              <p style="font-family: pmdfont;font-size:150%;">This project is our own Pokémon Mystery Dungeon game, made in Touhou Danmakufu ph3!<br>We are making the story from scratch, and we aim to have as much original material as possible while still maintaining the feel for the game (i.e. many fonts, sprites, sfx, and other graphical resources will be taken from Pokémon Mystery Dungeon Red, Blue, Time, Darkness, and Sky, partially due to our limitations and partially for authenticity).<br>As per doujin guidelines and due to the Pokémon Company's copyrights, this game will be distributed for free and we will assume all costs associated with commissions.<br>I plan to update this devlog every day I have done something for the project. As the person who has declared responsibility for the entirety of dungeon creation, I will try to make the game as authentic and fun to play as possible, and of course... it wouldn't do if we didn't have new items, right?<br>-snicker-</p>

              <div class="indexdevlogA">
	      <p class="indexdevlogtitleA">Today was as uneventful as could be in terms of development - I had a lot of work to do, so I had no time to develop. In the end, all I did was make a folder for future tilesets, rename lib to lib_Sparen because we'll have separate overworld and dungeon libraries, and create files for ObjPEnemy and ObjPPlayer, which will be used for dungeon enemies and dungeon players, respectively. They haven't been tested (almost nothing has been...), but they will be in due time, though I will need to give them something other than a constructor...</p>
	      <p class="indexdevlogtitleA">I did a bit of experimenting with tiles and dungeon floors, and I soon came to the realization that a 100x80 tile floor was too large, so I shrunk it to 75x60. Then I did the math and realized that I would need a whopping <b>4500</b> tile objects, which is far too many for Danmakufu to ever possibly handle, as well as the fact that indexing the 2D array would be a major problem.</p>
	      <p class="indexdevlogtitleA">I eventually shrunk it down to 60x48, which I will use for testing as it is a good size. At this point, I also learned that each tile is represented in the Minimap by four pixels - effectively the dungeon is a 6:1 scale to the Minimap. The space I had set aside for the Minimap in the STG_Frame was only big enough to handle a 36x31 (or 34x29, to give padding with the edge) floor, so I was forced to ditch it entirely. In the game, the mini map, if implemented, will most likely be rendered over the actual dungeon like in the actual games simply because there is no place to cram it that is big enough.</p>
	      <p class="indexdevlogtitleA">Wow... this devlog was far longer than I expected given that I have done literally nothing today for this project except for a few lines of code and 0 testing.</p>

              <div class="indexdevlogA">
	      <p class="indexdevlogtitleA">Today began with even less fanfare than yesterday. I did a few things here and there, and wrote some ObjTile, although it was basically limited to x and y positioning. I had a talk with Frentic about various things, and then decided to go and actually implement my tests!</p>
	      <p class="indexdevlogtitleA">(What I am leaving out here is the four or so hours I spent trying to decrypt and rip the base graphics of Explorers of Sky, as well as the playtime I had, where I soon realized that we would need a new set of virtual keys to make up for the A, B, X, Y, L, R, start, and select buttons. Horrifying.)</p>
	      <p class="indexdevlogtitleA">Over the course of a few long hours, I moved and ported existing libraries, purged code, and made a STG_Frame using Frentic's graphics. And then came the beautiful part - actually making the tests.</p>
	      <p class="indexdevlogtitleA">I decided on the name Runesvale Plain for my testing dungeon. I made a stage file with bare minimum, and made a plural to load individual floors. Stages will function as dungeon dives, plurals will serve as locations (dungeons, boss rooms), and singles will serve as individual floors. I made a new set of libraries in lib_dungeon for these, such as a common file and my first item spawn percentage sheet. I guess I'll have an enemy spawn sheet as well in the future.</p>
	      <p class="indexdevlogtitleA">At this point, I wanted to make a location opener, but... I didn't have the font. I searched and search to no avail.</p>
	      <p class="indexdevlogtitleA">...but thankfully, Miransu recognized it immediately - it was Tekton Bold, and coding began... only for Danmakufu to freeze. I'll leave out the pain and suffering, but let's just say that I forgot a ", and that screwed up <i>everything</i>. At the same time, all of my libraries were run through the syntax checker and I had to fix literally every include statement and Obj_SetValueD call in all of my libraries. A pain.</p>
	      <p class="indexdevlogtitleA">In the end though... all worked out. I managed to get everything I wanted to get working working, and I'm really glad. Because now... I feel like I've really accomplished something, even if what I have done is miniscule in reality. Basically, I never planned to be writing the GUI and dungeon spawning code after what, 5 days? It's a fulfilling feeling, especially when listening to the Gates to Infinity BGM (which is better than the game).</p>

	      <p class="indexdevlogtitleA">Today began with relatively no fanfare. Another snow day. But that meant that I had, of course, time to make function libraries!</p>
	      <p class="indexdevlogtitleA">I began with lib_ObjPokemon, which was to hold everything about a Pokemon that could possibly exist (yeah, I know). Turns out it was a harder endeavor than I thought. Implementing HP and types and stats was fine. I made lib_ObjStatusEffect while I was at it, which became a nightmare, so I moved all of the constants to a constant file instead - the actual library just includes the constant sheet, which is sort of sad and sort of relieving at the same time.</p>
	      <p class="indexdevlogtitleA">lib_ObjPokemon was fine. I added terrain, a way to initialize from Dex No. like I had set up for ObjAttack, and also added stuff for size and specie. But then I wanted to fill in the data in ObjPokemon_LoadSpecieFromID(obj, ID). So I decided to write a C program to do it for me since I knew I was fully capable of it.</p>
	      <p class="indexdevlogtitleA">A while later, I had my Makefile and my C file, and I gagged when it spit out 344 kB of code. And this was the <i>SKELETON</i> - none of the actual fields were filled with meaningful information. In the future, I'll be rerunning this program with even more functions...</p>
	      <p class="indexdevlogtitleA">Regardless, AchySolrock volunteered to make Tilesets, which is going to be helpful, although the time for that is in the future - I haven't implement a basic const_ObjAbility yet, and ObjTile is going to be one of the biggest endeavors in the library creation phase. And mind you, I haven't actually tested ANY of this code - I have to hope it works as expected.</p>
	      <p class="indexdevlogtitleA">Still, the pride of making my first C program that wasn't for a class... it was amazing. I'd dump it here on the website, but putting it in a pre block is about as close to disaster as I could ever get, so I will hold off on that - especially since it is still in development.</p>
	      <p class="indexdevlogtitleA">As for BGM, I got the dungeon tracks for Gates to Infinity, and it'll be nice to have more sacrificial testing bgms to choose from.</p>

              <h2 style="color:rgb(59,248,80)" id="submar052015">March 5, 2015</h2>
              <div class="indexdevlogA">
	      <p class="indexdevlogtitleA">So today was the day when I first saw Frentic's beautiful and amazing work. Although it was a proof-of-concept, it was amazingly well done, with animations, bgm, correct text formatting, collision detection, and more. I was awed, especially after my failures in Java and the realization from other members of LOCAA that this project <i>might actually be possible.</i> So Frentic reached out, and voila. I accepted.</p>
	      <p class="indexdevlogtitleA">This devlog is here because it NEEDS to be here. If I don't keep a devlog, I don't know how I will be able to vent my rage and joy. We're not using Github or Dropbox (yet) since I have to get to sumer break first, so I'm preparing all of the function libraries in advance of implementation. I made lib_ObjAttack three days ago as a proof of concept (for creating our own classes and data structures in Danmakufu - it's way more clunky than in C and nowhere near as convenient as Java), but now it seems I may be using it...</p>
	      <p class="indexdevlogtitleA">I expanded my paltry lib_ObjAttack with elemental types, more attack types, Power Points, crit rate, accuracy, and names, among other things. I also set up a create w/ name which may be of use in the development phase, as well as our main ObjAttack creator - ObjAttack_CreateEXB(ID), which takes a numerical ID (each attack will have its own ID) and will load literally everything by using a switch statement. Granted, I may have some issues with this later (I will. It's programming.), but I've got to give it my best shot.</p>
	      <p class="indexdevlogtitleA">As for const_Item, which I began work on immediately after deciding that I was going to go along with making this project in Danmakufu, it became a slugfest as I drudged my way through Serebii.net and Bulbapedia. It currently stands at 11 kB of sheer text (all of it constants so that we can identify items by a single number in the future), and is only going to grow as we implement more things. Granted, I can probably remove most of the items, although I have provisions for a couple thousand left in the list.</p>
	      <p class="indexdevlogtitleA">So, do you want to watch this project? If you do, here will be the place. Not on MotK - this isn't a Touhou project. Everything will link here to the devlog until we have some measure of completion done. Hopefully this project will live... and overcome its hurdles.</p>
	      <p class="indexdevlogtitleA">It will be a lot of work. A LOT of work. But it will pay off, both for ourselves and for those who love Pok&eacute;mon Mystery Dungeon. We'll have to make most of the tilesets and all of the bgm at the very least, and hopefully... one day... we will be able to play the game we made ourselves...</p>
	      <p class="indexdevlogtitleA">Below is the post from Facebook:</p>
	      <blockquote class="indexdevlogtitleA">It's sort of official, I guess! I'll be working with FrenticPony over the next year or so to make our own Pokémon Mystery Dungeon in Touhou Danmakufu!
...that is, assuming we both have the patience to get past the first major hurdle - system creation and unification.
...and since he already has a dialogue system and the like in place (sort of), it's my job to figure out how to write the entire dungeon system, including attacks, items, mechanics, statuses, ranges, item spawn percentages, tiles and tile graphics, and all of that other good stuff. And of course, saving progress, which shouldn't be terrible given that I just spent an hour writing a constant sheet with about 400 existing items that have already been dumped on my to-do list.
Summer will be great~
(Now... as for tile set replacement, figuring out the animations, and obtaining all of our bgm... that's a different story...)
I guess I'll have to choose a sacrificial bgm for my testing dungeon, because I'll be listening to it until I'm sick of it.</blockquote>
