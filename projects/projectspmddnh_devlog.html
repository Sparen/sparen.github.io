              <div class="indexdevlogA" id="submar052015">
	      <p class="indexdevlogtitleA">So today was the day when I first saw Frentic's beautiful and amazing work. Although it was a proof-of-concept, it was amazingly well done, with animations, bgm, correct text formatting, collision detection, and more. I was awed, especially after my failures in Java and the realization from other members of LOCAA that this project <i>might actually be possible.</i> So Frentic reached out, and voila. I accepted.</p>
	      <p class="indexdevlogtitleA">This devlog is here because it NEEDS to be here. If I don't keep a devlog, I don't know how I will be able to vent my rage and joy. We're not using Github or Dropbox (yet) since I have to get to sumer break first, so I'm preparing all of the function libraries in advance of implementation. I made lib_ObjAttack three days ago as a proof of concept (for creating our own classes and data structures in Danmakufu - it's way more clunky than in C and nowhere near as convenient as Java), but now it seems I may be using it...</p>
	      <p class="indexdevlogtitleA">I expanded my paltry lib_ObjAttack with elemental types, more attack types, Power Points, crit rate, accuracy, and names, among other things. I also set up a create w/ name which may be of use in the development phase, as well as our main ObjAttack creator - ObjAttack_CreateEXB(ID), which takes a numerical ID (each attack will have its own ID) and will load literally everything by using a switch statement. Granted, I may have some issues with this later (I will. It's programming.), but I've got to give it my best shot.</p>
	      <p class="indexdevlogtitleA">As for const_Item, which I began work on immediately after deciding that I was going to go along with making this project in Danmakufu, it became a slugfest as I drudged my way through Serebii.net and Bulbapedia. It currently stands at 11 kB of sheer text (all of it constants so that we can identify items by a single number in the future), and is only going to grow as we implement more things. Granted, I can probably remove most of the items, although I have provisions for a couple thousand left in the list.</p>
	      <p class="indexdevlogtitleA">So, do you want to watch this project? If you do, here will be the place. Not on MotK - this isn't a Touhou project. Everything will link here to the devlog until we have some measure of completion done. Hopefully this project will live... and overcome its hurdles.</p>
	      <p class="indexdevlogtitleA">It will be a lot of work. A LOT of work. But it will pay off, both for ourselves and for those who love Pok&eacute;mon Mystery Dungeon. We'll have to make most of the tilesets and all of the bgm at the very least, and hopefully... one day... we will be able to play the game we made ourselves...</p>
	      <p class="indexdevlogtitleA">Below is the post from Facebook:</p>
	      <blockquote class="indexdevlogtitleA">It's sort of official, I guess! I'll be working with FrenticPony over the next year or so to make our own Pokémon Mystery Dungeon in Touhou Danmakufu!
...that is, assuming we both have the patience to get past the first major hurdle - system creation and unification.
...and since he already has a dialogue system and the like in place (sort of), it's my job to figure out how to write the entire dungeon system, including attacks, items, mechanics, statuses, ranges, item spawn percentages, tiles and tile graphics, and all of that other good stuff. And of course, saving progress, which shouldn't be terrible given that I just spent an hour writing a constant sheet with about 400 existing items that have already been dumped on my to-do list.
Summer will be great~
(Now... as for tile set replacement, figuring out the animations, and obtaining all of our bgm... that's a different story...)
I guess I'll have to choose a sacrificial bgm for my testing dungeon, because I'll be listening to it until I'm sick of it.</blockquote>
