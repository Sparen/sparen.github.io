	      <h2 style="color:red"><span class="sttjheader2"><u>General Information</u></span></h2><hr>
	      <h3 style="color:red"><span class="sttjheader3">Personality</span></h3>
		<p>Ryusuke is a somewhat lonely and very loyal person who, although he tries to be fierce and powerful, would rather cuddle with kittens than fight. He's quite cheerful, yet melancholy.</p>
	      <h3 style="color:red"><span class="sttjheader3">Abilities</span></h3>
		<p>Given his current form, it would seem that he has a number of superhuman abilities, and this is in fact the case, but not to a great extent. While his mechanical limbs have very high durability, the advantages do not extend much farther than that.</p>
		<p>Ryusuke's attacks are based on manipulating flame - he carries a flamethrower around with him and then manipulates the flames with a currently undisclosed method.</p>
	      <h3 style="color:red"><span class="sttjheader3">Occupation</span></h3>
		<p>As of the ending of Adamantine Memory Blade, he lives with Teiki and Gen in their house.</p>
	      <h2 style="color:red"><span class="sttjheader2"><u>Backstory</u></span></h2><hr>
		<p>Ryusuke was a normal boy until when one day, he was riding on a light rail vehicle when a car being driven by a drunk driver smashed into the vehicle he was in, resulting in his legs being amputated by a sharp piece of metal. After that, he was wheelchair ridden and for the next 10 years of his life, he grew farther from his friends due to his physical condition. On the 10th anniversary of the accident, he was hit by a car a block away from the old crash site, and he died, being reincarnated into Daiten Daichi.</p>
	      <h2 style="color:red"><span class="sttjheader2"><u>Character Design</u></span></h2><hr>
	      <h3 style="color:red"><span class="sttjheader3">Origin</span></h3>
		<p>Ryusuke was created along with the other non-robot cast members for stages 1-5, although the concept for his character was imagined beforehand. As Stage 5 boss, he was chosen to be a future player character.</p>
	      <h3 style="color:red"><span class="sttjheader3">Name</span></h3>
		<p>Literally meaning "Steel Bullet Dragon Helper", Ryusuke's name, just like Teiki's, was thrown together in a vain attempt to come up with something decent.</p>
	      <h3 style="color:red"><span class="sttjheader3">Design</span></h3>
		<p>Ryusuke is relatively tall, although he is slightly shorter than Teiki. He has whitish and black hair, and has blue eyes. He has burn marks all around his abdomen from his unfortunate and various accidents with moving vehicles, which extend downwards to where his mechanical legs connect with the rest of his body. He covers most of these with dark flaming pants, which make the marks seem less like burn scars and more like tattoos or paint/style.</p>
		<p>Ryusuke is rather thin, though the human portion of his body is toned and rather muscular due to his training.</p>
	      <h2 style="color:red"><span class="sttjheader2"><u>Ryusuke's Appearances</u></span></h2><hr>
	      <h3 style="color:red"><span class="sttjheader3">SeitenTouji 1 - Adamantine Memory Blade</span></h3>
		<p>Ryusuke is the Stage 5 Boss and Stage 6 Midboss, and is loyal to the final boss. He tries to block Teiki from investigating further but fails miserably. After the events of the game, he decides to stick with Teiki.</p>
	      <h2 style="color:red"><span class="sttjheader2"><u>Relationships</u></span></h2><hr>
	      <h3 style="color:red"><span class="sttjheader3">Teiki Tetsurou</span></h3>
		<p>Ryusuke has a great attachment to <a href="./bio_teiki.html">Teiki</a>, mainly because of his many years of isolation from others. Teiki acts as Ryusuke's cuddle buddy whenever kittens are not around.</p>
	      <h3 style="color:red"><span class="sttjheader3">Gen'eimaru Hibyou</span></h3>
		<p>Ryusuke has a strange relationship with <a href="./bio_geneimaru.html">Gen</a>, as Ryusuke loves cats. Gen is, for all practical purposes, Ryusuke's pet. See Gen's page for their special attack, 'Phantom Strike'.</p>
	      <h3 style="color:red"><span class="sttjheader3">Other Relationships</span></h3>
		<p>N/A</p>
	      <h2 style="color:red"><span class="sttjheader2"><u>ExAttacks</u></span></h2><hr>
		<h4>Creation of Flame 「Molten Fangs of the Conflagrant Wolf」</h4>
		<h4>Creation of Flame 「Brilliant Glowing School of Brilliant Fish」</h4>
		<p>TBD</p>
	      <h2 style="color:red"><span class="sttjheader2"><u>Additional Information</u></span></h2><hr>
		<p>Ryusuke was designed by Sparen</p>
