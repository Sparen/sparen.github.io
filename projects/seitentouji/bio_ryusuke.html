	      <h2 style="color:red"><span class="sttjheader2"><u>General Information</u></span></h2><hr>
	      <h3 style="color:red"><span class="sttjheader3">Personality</span></h3>
		<p>Ryusuke is a somewhat lonely and very loyal person who, although he tries to be fierce and powerful, would rather cuddle with kittens than fight. He's quite cheerful when conversing with others, yet melancholy and introverted at other times, tending to keep to himself and not burden others with his problems and worries.</p>
		<p>Although he's dependent on others upon arrival in Daiten Daichi due to being supported by others during life, he gradually learns to become self-sufficient again - a task made easier by his skill at cooking and food preparation, and his years of studying.</p>
		<p>Ryusuke is not OK with human-driven vehicles of any sort and in general cannot tolerate any heavy, fast-moving objects due to being mutilated and killed by such vehicles while alive. Surprisingly, he is OK with fire despite the flames that resulted from his unfortunate life incidents. This may be due to him always being cold back when he was alive - something only abated when cooking or when with another person.</p>
	      <h3 style="color:red"><span class="sttjheader3">Abilities</span></h3>
		<p>Given his current form, it would seem that he has a number of superhuman abilities, and this is in fact the case, but not to a great extent. While his mechanical limbs have very high durability, the advantages do not extend much farther than that.</p>
		<p>Ryusuke's attacks are based on manipulating flame - he carries a flamethrower around with him and then manipulates the flames to form whatever shapes he wishes. The flames typically feature animals and animal features.</p>
	      <h3 style="color:red"><span class="sttjheader3">Occupation</span></h3>
		<p>As of the ending of Adamantine Memory Blade, he lives with Teiki and Gen in their house, acting as an incident resolver. He also handles cooking, agriculture, and other domestic tasks.</p>
	      <h2 style="color:red"><span class="sttjheader2"><u>Backstory</u></span></h2><hr>
		<p>Ryusuke was a normal boy until when one day, he was riding on a light rail vehicle when a car being driven by a drunk driver smashed into the vehicle he was in, resulting in his legs being amputated by a sharp piece of metal. After that, he was wheelchair ridden and for the next 10 years of his life, he grew farther from his friends due to his physical condition. On the 10th anniversary of the accident, he was hit by a car a block away from the old crash site, and he died, being reincarnated into Daiten Daichi.</p>
		<p>Once in Daiten Daichi, he was picked up by Dyne, who he accepted as his 'master'.</p>
	      <h2 style="color:red"><span class="sttjheader2"><u>Character Design</u></span></h2><hr>
	      <h3 style="color:red"><span class="sttjheader3">Origin</span></h3>
		<p>Ryusuke was created along with the other non-robot cast members for stages 1-5, although the concept for his character was imagined beforehand. As Stage 5 boss, he was chosen to be a future player character.</p>
	      <h3 style="color:red"><span class="sttjheader3">Name</span></h3>
		<p>Literally meaning "Steel Bullet Dragon Helper", Ryusuke's name, just like Teiki's, was thrown together in a vain attempt to come up with something decent.</p>
	      <h3 style="color:red"><span class="sttjheader3">Design</span></h3>
		<p>Ryusuke is relatively tall, although he is slightly shorter than Teiki. He has whitish and darkish brown black hair, and has blue eyes. He has burn marks all around his abdomen from his unfortunate and various accidents with moving vehicles, which extend downwards to where his mechanical legs connect with the rest of his body. He covers most of these with dark flaming pants, which make the marks seem less like burn scars and more like tattoos or paint/style.</p>
		<p>The entirety of his body below his waistline is scarred.</p>
		<p>Ryusuke is rather thin, though the human portion of his body is toned and rather muscular due to his training.</p>
	      <h2 style="color:red"><span class="sttjheader2"><u>Ryusuke's Appearances</u></span></h2><hr>
	      <h3 style="color:red"><span class="sttjheader3">SeitenTouji 1 - Adamantine Memory Blade</span></h3>
		<p>Ryusuke is the Stage 5 Boss, and is loyal to the final boss. He tries to block Teiki from investigating further but fails miserably. After the events of the game, he decides to stick with Teiki.</p>
	      <h2 style="color:red"><span class="sttjheader2"><u>Relationships</u></span></h2><hr>
	      <h3 style="color:red"><span class="sttjheader3">Teiki Tetsurou</span></h3>
		<p>Ryusuke has a great attachment to <a href="./bio_teiki.html">Teiki</a>, mainly because of his many years of isolation from others. Willingly or not, Teiki acts as Ryusuke's cuddle buddy whenever kittens are not around. Ryusuke is a tsundere, which Teiki is fine with.</p>
		<p>Some inhabitants of Daiten Daichi, Ryusuke himself included, know that his obsession with Teiki is a little weird, and the Stockholm Syndrome-esque origins of their relationship don't help that. Still, Teiki doesn't mind Ryusuke's company. Or his cooking, which is far better than anything Teiki can make.</p>
	      <h3 style="color:red"><span class="sttjheader3">Maryuu</span></h3>
		<p>As 'Bro Ryusuke', Ryusuke often caves to <a href="./bio_maryuu.html">Maryuu</a>'s requests for fire shows. To his relief, he doesn't get doted on as much - probably since he doesn't spend as much time near the village.</p>
	      <h3 style="color:red"><span class="sttjheader3">Dyne</span></h3>
		<p>As Ryusuke's former 'boss' and mentor of sorts, <a href="./bio_dyne.html">Dyne</a> provided Ryusuke with a purpose for living and effectively halted Ryusuke's fall to a Lost Soul. To Ryusuke, Dyne was someone he served - someone who gave his existence meaning. Even after the incidents in AMB, they maintain that kind of relationship.</p>
	      <h3 style="color:red"><span class="sttjheader3">Gen'eimaru Hibyou</span></h3>
		<p>Ryusuke has a strange relationship with <a href="./bio_geneimaru.html">Gen</a>, as Ryusuke loves cats. Gen is, for all practical purposes, Ryusuke's pet. See Gen's page for their special attack, 'Phantom Strike'.</p>
	      <h3 style="color:red"><span class="sttjheader3">Other Relationships</span></h3>
