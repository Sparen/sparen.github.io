	      <h2 style="color:#BBBBCC"><span class="sttjheader2"><u>General Information</u></span></h2><hr>
	      <h3 style="color:#BBBBCC"><span class="sttjheader3">Personality</span></h3>
		<p>Kentaro is a hyperactive and curious boy who likes finding out about the abilities of others. He also loves games, anime, manga, and werewolves. Surprisingly kinky too.</p>
		<p>Kentaro is also noteworthy for his intense loyalty to the Cherry Village and Yutaro's mission. This stems from the 'second chance' he was given, the ability to live the life he wanted to live, and his eagerness to be who he wants to be. Originally shy, reclusive, and introverted from discrimination and bullying in life, he has transitioned to someone who is not afraid to show his true self to others - someone who wants to devote his life to protecting those who have given him his new life.</p>
		<p>Despite changing his body on the genetic level to be a different race from when he was alive, he has not entirely abandoned the remnants of the Salish culture he inherited and instead fiercely protects those memories, cultural aspects, and traditions. This is despite his attempts in life to distance himself from his heritage as much as possible.</p>
		<p>Oh, and he's as straight as the flagpole which he proudly keeps at his side. But since he only ever got 2D waifus in life, it's... not too bad, I guess? Wait, that's even sadder...</p>
		<p>His favorite RPGs are Tales of Vesperia and Ookami, and his favorite Anime is Spice And Wolf. His favorite data structure is the Linked List.</p>
	      <h3 style="color:#BBBBCC"><span class="sttjheader3">Abilities</span></h3>
		<p>Kentaro is able to take anything and both 'split' and 'pair' them. This includes splitting danmaku and then merging the pieces back together, and also includes splitting himself in a way - the effect is that of a good 'ol Shadow Clone. This ability, by extension, makes him an excellent team builder and matchmaker, as he can tell who would be good fits for one another.</p>
		<p>In addition, Kentaro has inherited the ability of shapeshifting his own soul and occasionally leaves his body in order to keep watch over the village from the cliffs above as a guardian wolf. In this form, he is able to absorb energy from the environment and it is believed that in this form, if he were to be attacked, he could probably shake off an ICBM. For this reason, Taro hypothesizes that even if Kentaro were to become a Divine Soul, he would remain bound to the Cherry Village, guarding it even after passing on.</p>
		<p>Kentaro's attack style is TBD.</p>
	      <h3 style="color:#BBBBCC"><span class="sttjheader3">Occupation</span></h3>
		<p>As of the ending of Stolen Secrets of Hope, Kentaro is still living in the Cherry Village, acting as a particularly talkative sentinel.</p>
	      <h2 style="color:#BBBBCC"><span class="sttjheader2"><u>Backstory</u></span></h2><hr>
		<p>Before reincarnation, Kentaro was an ordinary high school student who loved to draw and immerse himself in various forms of media. However, his (extremely traditional) parents disowned him when the police came to their house over his pirating of multiple anime series and they <i>discovered</i> his "collection". He spent a year in juvenile detention before committing suicide. Somehow, his body was obliterated during the process.</p>
		<p>After reincarnation, he was given an android body by the Road of Machinery, and settled in the Village of the Androids before moving to the Cherry Village, where he met Yutaro and Akitora. He was the third guinea pig to get a new body and was well-made enough to be the prototype for future transitions. His decision to switch his race was not taken lightly, but Akitora ceased his complaints after utilizing his ability. Kentaro himself justified the change by stating that his bloodline had already been contaminated and that as long as he remained loyal to his beliefs, being of a different race did not matter.</p>
	      <h2 style="color:#BBBBCC"><span class="sttjheader2"><u>Character Design</u></span></h2><hr>
	      <h3 style="color:#BBBBCC"><span class="sttjheader3">Origin</span></h3>
		<p>Kentaro was created on January 29, 2017 along with all other SSH characters.</p>
	      <h3 style="color:#BBBBCC"><span class="sttjheader3">Name</span></h3>
		<p>His chosen last name, Kibaarashi, literally means fang storm, while his slightly altered name, Kentaro, replaces whatever kanji used to be there (Ken) with the kanji for dog (also Ken).</p>
		<p>Back when he was alive, he had a tribal name and suffered greatly for it due to discrimination within the Seattle public school system and the inhabitants of the city itself.</p>
	      <h3 style="color:#BBBBCC"><span class="sttjheader3">Design</span></h3>
		<p>Kentaro is of above average height for an ordinary high schooler, with silvery gray hair, ears, and tail, similarly to a wolf in coloration. His tail is rather bushy and wags when he's excited.</p>
		<p>Kentaro is rather muscular, and he wears a tank top and shorts. His tank top is plain but he also has AWOO, Momiji, and other assorted designs in his closet. His shorts are rather ordinary, except that there's a hole for his tail.</p>
		<p>It's noteworthy that Kentaro's form in Daiten Daichi does not mirror his appearance when he was alive, as he chose to change his physical appearance on the genetic level, including his skin color and facial structure. This primarily stems from issues he faced when still alive. His procedure was influenced by Akitora's ability, though Akitora did not communicate directly with Yutaro during the process. This had the positive effect of maintaining Kentaro's overall physical structure and attributes he wasn't self-conscious about, allowing him to function almost exactly the same in his new body as he was able to during life.</p>
