	      <h2 style="color:palegreen"><span class="sttjheader2"><u>General Information</u></span></h2><hr>
	      <h3 style="color:palegreen"><span class="sttjheader3">Personality</span></h3>
		<p>Teiki is a calm and adamant person who keeps quiet and tries not to stand out too much. He's the kind of person who approaches even the most incomprehensible situations and analyzes them calmly. He also has a love for mechanics and machines, which comes into play greatly in the events of Adamantine Memory Blade. He's not as good when it comes to theoretical approaches, however.</p>
	      <h3 style="color:palegreen"><span class="sttjheader3">Abilities</span></h3>
		<p>As a normal human, he has no inherent abilities. However, he is extremely good at creating things from whatever is in front of him, and he is extremely calm and perceptive. He is also good at maintaining and understanding the theory behind robots, and he is capable of both creating robots and, to an extent, manipulating electricity.</p>
		<p>Teiki's attacks depend on creating and manipulating robot familiars, as well as manipulating the electricity from a piezoelectric generator he carries with him.</p>
	      <h3 style="color:palegreen"><span class="sttjheader3">Occupation</span></h3>
		<p>As of the ending of Adamantine Memory Blade, he lives with Ryusuke and Gen in their house.</p>
	      <h2 style="color:palegreen"><span class="sttjheader2"><u>Backstory</u></span></h2><hr>
		<p>Very little is known about Teiki before he died, as he refuses to tell anyone who asks.</p>
		<p>It is rumored that he has a dark and majestic past, but he's just an ordinary college kid. Seriously. That's all.</p>
		<p>...Or is he? Hmm...</p>
	      <h2 style="color:palegreen"><span class="sttjheader2"><u>Character Design</u></span></h2><hr>
	      <h3 style="color:palegreen"><span class="sttjheader3">Origin</span></h3>
		<p>Teiki was created on March 16, 2015, with his abilities, options, and some personality details. On March 18, 2015, he was drawn and rendered.</p>
	      <h3 style="color:palegreen"><span class="sttjheader3">Name</span></h3>
		<p>Literally meaning "Machine Body Steel Wolf", Teiki's name was thrown together in a vain attempt to come up with something decent.</p>
	      <h3 style="color:palegreen"><span class="sttjheader3">Design</span></h3>
		<p>Teiki is relatively tall, with spiky silvery hair and olive eyes. He wears a red headband with the kanji for iron on it.</p>
	      <h2 style="color:palegreen"><span class="sttjheader2"><u>Teiki's Appearances</u></span></h2><hr>
	      <h3 style="color:palegreen"><span class="sttjheader3">SeitenTouji 1 - Adamantine Memory Blade</span></h3>
		<p>Teiki wakes up in an unfamiliar world. Not knowing where he is, he sets out to explore. Eventually, he finds a village of androids who are being manipulated and decides to help them.</p>
	      <h2 style="color:palegreen"><span class="sttjheader2"><u>Relationships</u></span></h2><hr>
	      <h3 style="color:palegreen"><span class="sttjheader3">Ryusuke Koudan</span></h3>
		<p>Teiki is friends with <a href="./bio_ryusuke.html">Ryusuke</a>, whose mechanical parts he maintains. Teiki is not entirely oblivious to Ryusuke's fondness for him, and the two share a strange and oftentimes uncomfortable relationship, mainly due to Ryusuke really being attached to Teiki and due to Teiki being more interested in how Ryusuke's cyborg body functions than him as a person (at least soon after they first meet). Their relationship will develop over the course of the series.</p>
	      <h3 style="color:palegreen"><span class="sttjheader3">Other Relationships</span></h3>
		<p>Teiki, as a person who travels a lot, interacts with a number of characters. However, he doesn't have notable relationships with most, as he sees them perhaps once and never again. Teiki is also not the most sociable of people.</p>
	      <h2 style="color:palegreen"><span class="sttjheader2"><u>ExAttacks</u></span></h2><hr>
