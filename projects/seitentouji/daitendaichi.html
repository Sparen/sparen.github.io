          <p>Daiten Daichi is a world of mysteries - one of strange occurrences and supernatural phenomena. However, its size and scope are well known.</p>
          <p>Daiten Daichi has existed for a very long time - after all, it is a form of afterlife. All of the inhabitants are male, and died under the age of 30, possessing nothing but their own memories. Those who died without enough of their body intact to remain living reincarnate as <strong>Free Souls</strong>, while those with bodies or, rather, those with enough of their bodies to survive, reincarnate as such, with their missing limbs remaining missing.</p>
          <p>After many years, the inhabitants of Daiten Daichi who find peace tend to become <strong>Divine Souls </strong>, while those who are unable to become <strong>Lost Souls </strong>. Divine Souls and Lost Souls can retain physical bodies if they have them, but the structure of their presence within Daiten Daichi changes.</p>
          <p>Souls of all types, regardless of whether or not they have physical bodies, are capable of thought and have basic senses as well as standard memory, etc. It is by communicating with Free Souls that Taiga and co. construct bodies for them. Free Souls are capable of inhabiting artificial bodies, but they are not bound to those bodies and can be forcefully removed from them. Weapons such as the Adamantine Memory Blade are capable of manipulating Free Souls who have chosen inorganic bodies to inhabit.</p>
          <p>Some inhabitants, such as Taro, are capable of using Souls to attack, as Souls produce large amounts of Spirit Energy, the force driving the vast majority of the supernatural abilities in Daiten Daichi, and which is often transmuted into danmaku.</p>
          <p>It is of particular note that humans are not the only creatures to reincarnate in Daiten Daichi, but given the situation with Gen'eimaru, it is probable that such events are rare and only happen in exceptional cases.</p>
	  <h1 style="color:rgb(64,192,160);text-align:center;">Geography</h1>
          <p>Daiten Daichi is geographically a mirror of Earth, except that many forms of animal life seem to not exist due to lack of human migration and agriculture, resulting in a very different type of environment than modern Earth, with native fauna and flora dominating. Additionally, human settlements are few and far between.</p>
          <p>The part of Daiten Daichi where Teiki and co. reside is lush and green, with flowing rivers surrounded by mountains. Winters and summers are mild, and the world as a whole doesn't change very much. It is the equivalent of Saitama Prefecture, Japan.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p></p>
          <p></p>
	  <h1 style="color:rgb(64,192,160);text-align:center;">Politics</h1>
          <p>The portion of Daiten Daichi where Teiki and co. reside is a city-state system, where each settlement or group of settlements self-governs. Due to the lack of living population, there are no real cities, though large towns are common.</p>
          <p>In the part of Daiten Daichi where Teiki and co. reside, there are notable forms of government - the Road of Machinery and the factories form a cooperative unit in association with the Village of the Androids. The two governments are essentially socialist.</p>
          <p>The Cherry Village has a Mayor, while the Brotherhood is effectively a dictatorship.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p></p>
	  <h1 style="color:rgb(64,192,160);text-align:center;">Culture</h1>
          <p>Over its long history, Daiten Daichi has seen many different cultures, stemming from youths being picked from all across the globe regardless of language and cultural heritage. The fact that they are youths is important, as they lacked the resources and expertise to build society on their own. </p>
          <p>It is only recently, with the advent of the industrial revolution, that Daiten Daichi has begun to change. Of course, this change has been horribly slow because your average 20 year old doesn't know how to build much of anything from absolute scratch, but knowledge and expertise has accumulated over time, and with skilled minds like Taiga and Yutaro, natural resource mining and processing into goods has begun.</p>
          <p>Of course, given that the driving force behind everything is the power of imagination and the mind, individuals can do whatever they want to within the limitations of their abilities, and that power was used to bootstrap the current situation.</p>
