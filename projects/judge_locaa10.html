My Player: Default Aya

Difficulty: Normal

Nonspell 1: Solid nonspell. Nothing much to say here except the fact that the laser handling is done 
    quite well, as it forces the player to move around. [09/10]
Spell 1: Pretty decent. Overall not too interesting, but not a bad attack either. [16/20]
Nonspell 2: Once again, a good nonspell. However, the way the player must dodge attacks from all sorts 
    of directions is especially well-done, with the bullet trails forming an effective attack. [10/10]
Spell 2: The various mechanics you use here, such as the lasers, are quite effective and the execution is 
    particularly good here. Overall, pretty good. [18/20]
Spell 3: Pretty boring and lackluster compared to your second spell. Problems include yellow bullets on 
    yellow background, as well as the delay lasers spawning on the yellow lines. Danmaku overall is 
    subpar and boring. [13/20]

Comments
--Please don't have the log window open in your final submission. It's not good practice.
--Config menu should probably handle sound better. If you're going to play the Sound Effect every time 
  you change the setting, it should reflect the new percentage.
--Having front-down sprites and using them for a horizontal scroller doesn't really look so great.
--The familiar's rings in Focused Aya are exceptionally distracting. They also cover enemy bullets and 
  make it hard to tell where the player is.
--Player respawn point and the opacity of the player hitbox are both problematic - finding the player 
  on-screen can be hard.
--Be more careful as to contrast between graphics such as the background, enemy bullets, and player 
  bullets. In the case of this script, it's bad enough that I'm docking points from two different 
  categories.</pre>

My Player: ReiYukKom

Difficulty: Default

Nonspell 1: Solid attack. Just so happens that WishMakers did something exceptionally similar, but this 
    is challenging without being too unfair. [08/10]
Spell 1: The delay clouds make it seem like something more difficult is coming, so I was surprised when 
    that unimpressive number of bullets appeared. Still, solid attack. [16/20]
Nonspell 2: If it hadn't been for Reimu's f***ing talismans, this attack would have left a better 
    impression on me. Overall, quite a well-designed nonspell. Difficulty and style are both quite 
    appropriate. [09/10]
Spell 2: A well designed and quite interesting spell. Main complaint is bullets from bottom of screen, 
    but the way the bullets are handled as they are pushed out is well-executed. [18/20]
Nonspell 3: A wonderful nonspell completely ruined by the fact that Reimu's blue amulets render OVER the 
    enemy bullets. But that aside, pretty solid, well-done attack. [09/10]
Spell 3: An excellently handled and well-done attack that forces the player to move and adapt, but does 
    so with care. Could use a little more randomness in the flames, but otherwise quite good. [19/20]

--AAAAAAA same background issue as with your Wriggle.
--Reimu's blue amulets are f***ing distracting. Other players I chose were fine - I miss those previews 
  you used to have when choosing shottypes.
--Switching players and the triple player mechanic is a mess as usual when playing one of your triple 
  player scripts for the first time in a while.
--Music handling is superb. The transitions between the two tracks is expertly handled.</pre>

My Player: AMB TeikiA

Difficulty: Default

Nonspell 1: Simple, effective. May be a little hard the first time, but overall a pretty good nonspell. 
    [9/10]
Spell 1: The bullet delete effects contribute the majority of the difficulty, followed by the speed of 
    the initial lasers. It's an excellent idea but actually playing it, it feels exceptionally unfair. 
    [12/20]
Nonspell 2: Another excellent nonspell. However, the familiars' movement is very choppy and doesn't look 
    very good. [9/10]
Spell 2: A well-intentioned spell suffering from fade delete syndrome. This one, however, is pretty 
    solid, though not exceptional. Also, the lifebar can be completely invisible in this attack due to 
    the position of the boss. [15/20]
Nonspell 3: An effective but obnoxious attack. [07/10]
Spell 3: A well designed and effective attack. The way you provide an additional offset for the lasers 
    is well done, and makes the attack work much more effectively. Still, can be a little unintuitive at 
    first. [19/20]
Spell 4: Unintuitive bull$#!+ 80% of the time. The speed of the long bullets coming from the top of the 
    screen, sudden direction changes, and inability for the player to react if they have a slow player 
    ruins this spell. The idea is good, the execution is terrible. [06/20]

Comments
--The biggest problem with your script is the use of fade delete - it's not possible to tell when bullets 
  can no longer damage the player
--Lifebar can be very hard to see during spellcards due to its color.
--There are a number of minor bugs (sound effects after an attack has concluded, etc). These deductions 
  have been made to your Other Raw Score.</pre>

My Player: Default Reimu

Difficulty: Default

Spell 1: Dull and uninteresting, for the most part. [13/20]
Nonspell 1: An excellent nonspell forcing the player to macrododge and micrododge. The way the blue 
    bullet spawn further enhances the experience. [10/10]
Spell 2: It's not intuitive at first that he's aiming at the player, which can be a little problematic. 
    However, the overall quality of the spell is rather high. [17/20]
Spell 3: An interesting spell with a variety of different bullet techniques. Very effective in terms of 
    player movement and dodging strategy. [19/20]
Nonspell 2: Very Marisa-like. Overall, pretty solid. [8/10]
Spell 4: The aesthetic falls apart a little here. Overall, not amazing, but not bad either. [15/20]
Spell 5: Not a bad spell, but very repetitive and slightly obnoxious. The warping makes the lifebar try 
    to re-render, which is a little hilarious, but it could be handled more skillfully. [16/20]
Nonspell 3: Pretty standard. Nothing impressive. [8/10]
Spell 6: Significantly less exciting than it looks. But all and all, not a bad attack. [17/20]

My Player: Tsubakura Default

Difficulty: Normal, Hard

Nonspell 1: Simple, effective. The way the two waves interact works well. [9/10]
Spell 1: A well designed spell. I like the way the lasers telegraph other parts of the attack 
    effectively. My biggest complaint is that it's nearly impossible to figure out when the lasers will 
    spawn the first time. [18/20]
Nonspell 2: Another simple but effective nonspell. [9/10]
Spell 2: I like the way the player is forced to move around by the walls of orange flames, as well as 
    the way the wings further affect gameplay. My biggest complain would probably be the way the red 
    wings just fall straight at the very end - that last bit acting differently is a little unexpected. 
    I understand why you did it, though. [19/20]
Nonspell 3: Still solid, but feels like it's lacking something. Overall, not as impressive as the way 
    you handled the other nonspells, though it provides a much-needed change of pace with the nonspells. 
    [8/10]
Spell 3: The way you handle the telegraphing of the side lasers is effective. My big problem here is 
    that the delay lasers can be hard to see, so the fast player-aimed lasers can suddenly appear out of 
    nowhere due to the player shots covering up the delay lasers. Maybe making the delay lasers a little 
    brighter would help. Overall, solid but not super amazing. [16/20]
Spell 4: A well-designed multi-phase survival. The way you telegraph attacks with delay lasers and 
    effective delay cloud usage makes the attack that much better. I especially like the phases where 
    you force player movement - it's quite effective and the way you execute it is both fair and 
    interesting to dodge. The main issue is the very start, where it's not immediately obvious that 
    you'll be restricted in the circle (though it's still telegraphed fairly well). But otherwise, well 
    done. Do be aware that even on Hard Mode, the last 10-15 seconds are easier to dodge outside of the 
    circle rather than inside. [19/20]

My Player: A2 Marisa

Difficulty: Default

Nonspell 1: Dear God of Angular Velocity: I beg from you the sweet dream of salvation. But no, seriously, 
    that angular velocity plus the spinning graphics can be a little overkill. That said, it's a cool 
    attack. [07/10]
Spell 1: Whoa, I almost got hit on that first wave. But this is a well-executed attack overall. [18/20]
Nonspell 2: Another well-executed attack, though the difficulty of this one seems to depend on the player 
    character's hitbox render priority more than anything else, perhaps... [09/10]
Spell 2: Got instakilled. Please don't have the attack start during the spellcard declaration plz. 
    Unfortunately, the warping of the bullet is beyond my comprehension (it's the thing that one-shotted 
    me at the start, as it spawned right below me in the middle of the screen between the lasers.) Then 
    again, I assume it's supposed to be hard to figure out, because the lasers used as warp panels are so 
    hard to see the player might not even realize they're there. In the end, the good parts of the attack 
    are completely nullified by the speed and uncertainty in regards to the large bullet. [12/20]
Spell 3: Noobs beware - you will instantly die. Especially if you focus. I died on every single one of the 
    first three waves by crashing into the boss. The dense spiral is the ugliest of them - maneuverability 
    when your movement is being controlled is very painful. In the end, I bombed the rest of the spell.

Difficulty: Default

Nonspell 1: Solid, well balanced nonspell. I like the flower shapes and how the bullets are spawned 
    on-screen. [09/10]
Spell 1: Solid, self-explanatory spell with effective mechanics. Gets a little boring, but not bad. 
    [17/20]
Nonspell 2: Another good nonspell, though this one has more to it. The way it is handled is excellent, 
    as is the way the pattern forces the player to react. [10/10]
Spell 2: Movement restriction here is well-done, and the method in which the arrows interact with the 
    restricting lattice is also well-executed. Once again, gets boring, but quite a good spell. [18/20]
Spell 3: An excellent two-phase spellcard, where the phases work together to provide a better play 
    experience. The effective use of telegraphing of the explosions by starting at the center and going 
    outwards also prevents cheapshotting. My only problem with the attack is the underwhelmingness of 
    that spark. [19/20]
Spell 4: The charm mechanic isn't immediately obvious, as it is only telegraphed by a relatively faint 
    aura that the player likely will not see if they are focusing on the bullets. However, besides this, 
    it's a pretty solid multi-phase attack. [18/20]
Nonspell 3: An effective and well-made multi-phase nonspell. The way you add the square formations at 
    varying speeds and the way this formation interacts with the faster bullets is excellent. [10/10]
Spell 5: The completely inappropriate bounce sound effect aside, this is a typical but well-made 
    final-esque buildup spell. The layers build upon each other in a way that isn't too difficult but 
    also isn't too simple. [18/20]

Nonspell 1: If it weren't for Reimu being stupidly slow and the boss being so fast, I would have no 
    problem with this attack. Overall, solid. Nothing too spectacular but not bad either. [8/10]
Spell 1: A pretty interesting spell. I like how you used the moving hazards to force the player to move 
    in a restricted space, as well as the pressure caused by the external bullets. Well designed, though 
    a tad hard when the small bullets hide behind the big ones. [17/20]
Nonspell 2: Quite a good nonspell. I appreciate the way you handled the bullet explosions, though once 
    again, small faster bullets hide behind large and slow ones. Still, not bad. [9/10]
Spell 2: Unfortunately, though the spell itself is well-done and creative, the background is bright and 
    scrolling quickly underneath blue bullets of a similar color. Could use some improvements, but pretty 
    decent otherwise. [16/20]
Spell 3: Chaos. The first parts are OK, but the last phase comes out of nowhere. Not absolutely terrible 
    but poorly executed compared to the rest of the script. [13/20]
Spell 4 Phase 1: Quite well-designed and surprisingly pleasant to dodge. I especially like the way the 
    outwards bursts get closer to the player each time, as well as the way you handle the first half of 
    the attack as a whole. [10/10]
Spell 4 Phase 2: The spark comes out of nowhere but since it is well telegraphed, it's not a problem. 
    Overall, not as amazing as the first part but still quite well done. [09/10]
Spell 5: ANOTHER ATTACK?! Why am I not surprised. That said, it's pretty good until the 7-shaped bullet 
    formations appear. At this point, it begins to descend into bull****. mainly because the static effect 
    makes everything harder to see, and not because of the bullets. Thankfully you can dodge in the top 
    right and top left corners of the screen. [17/20]

My Player: Default

Difficulty: Default

Nonspell 1: Nothing special. But not too shabby either. Solid nonspell. Do note that the gray amulets
    easily blend straight into the background. [7/10]
Spell 1: Could really do with some sfx. The flame bullets could use some ADD as well - they are actually 
    a little hard to see. [14/20]
Nonspell 2: Overall, not shabby. But the knives blend in with the background and the delay clouds can be 
    hard to see. Sometimes the bullets just seem to appear out of nowhere. [7/10]
Spell 2: Not a bad spell, but feels a little empty. The icicles can be a little too sudden, I think, and 
    they are often too fast and too dense to dodge. [14/20]
Nonspell 3: A well-balanced attack that makes the player move around. Well executed. [9/10]
Spell 3: You have an issue here with some of the bolts - they go offscreen and delete, or something like 
    that. As a result, some of them are only one bullet long, and many have variable lengths. If that's 
    not intentional, do be aware that it makes the attack harder. [15/20]
Spell 4: Repetitive but not bad. I did expect the direction to switch halfway through, but that's just me. 
    Not bad, but not amazing. [14/20]
Spell 5: Things immediately come out of nowhere and then you have acceleration at very high speeds. It's 
    very easy to get killed standing on a delay cloud since everything spawns without warning. Not noob 
    friendly and still problematic as the survival proceeds. This is where I died on my first playthrough. 
    Near the end (last 20 seconds), there's a lot of crap on the screen and all of it blends in with the 
    background or something else. I just bombed through on my second playthrough. [10/20]
Spell 6: Overall pretty decent, though it's boring at the start and becomes quite chaotic later on due to 
    the graphics, etc. [15/20]

Comments
--Screen resolution changer didn't work for me at all. Might be a Wine thing.
--Option Menu - Sound Effect text overlapped with the actual volume number, so it was illegible.
  There were also decimal issues (100.00 vs 100)
--The main problems with your script aesthetically can be summarized as follows: Fade delete, Delay clouds, 
  bullets blend in with everything else.
--Main Menu "Options" is hard to see.
--End of game is quite sudden - you can't even collect the items.</pre>
