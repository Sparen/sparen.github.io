Nonspell 1: Solid attack. Just so happens that WishMakers did something exceptionally similar, but this 
    is challenging without being too unfair. [08/10]
Spell 1: The delay clouds make it seem like something more difficult is coming, so I was surprised when 
    that unimpressive number of bullets appeared. Still, solid attack. [16/20]
Nonspell 2: If it hadn't been for Reimu's f***ing talismans, this attack would have left a better 
    impression on me. Overall, quite a well-designed nonspell. Difficulty and style are both quite 
    appropriate. [09/10]
Spell 2: A well designed and quite interesting spell. Main complaint is bullets from bottom of screen, 
    but the way the bullets are handled as they are pushed out is well-executed. [18/20]
Nonspell 3: A wonderful nonspell completely ruined by the fact that Reimu's blue amulets render OVER the 
    enemy bullets. But that aside, pretty solid, well-done attack. [09/10]
Spell 3: An excellently handled and well-done attack that forces the player to move and adapt, but does 
    so with care. Could use a little more randomness in the flames, but otherwise quite good. [19/20]

--AAAAAAA same background issue as with your Wriggle.
--Reimu's blue amulets are f***ing distracting. Other players I chose were fine - I miss those previews 
  you used to have when choosing shottypes.
--Switching players and the triple player mechanic is a mess as usual when playing one of your triple 
  player scripts for the first time in a while.
--Music handling is superb. The transitions between the two tracks is expertly handled.</pre>

Nonspell 1: Nothing special. But not too shabby either. Solid nonspell. Do note that the gray amulets
    easily blend straight into the background. [7/10]
Spell 1: Could really do with some sfx. The flame bullets could use some ADD as well - they are actually 
    a little hard to see. [14/20]
Nonspell 2: Overall, not shabby. But the knives blend in with the background and the delay clouds can be 
    hard to see. Sometimes the bullets just seem to appear out of nowhere. [7/10]
Spell 2: Not a bad spell, but feels a little empty. The icicles can be a little too sudden, I think, and 
    they are often too fast and too dense to dodge. [14/20]
Nonspell 3: A well-balanced attack that makes the player move around. Well executed. [9/10]
Spell 3: You have an issue here with some of the bolts - they go offscreen and delete, or something like 
    that. As a result, some of them are only one bullet long, and many have variable lengths. If that's 
    not intentional, do be aware that it makes the attack harder. [15/20]
Spell 4: Repetitive but not bad. I did expect the direction to switch halfway through, but that's just me. 
    Not bad, but not amazing. [14/20]
Spell 5: Things immediately come out of nowhere and then you have acceleration at very high speeds. It's 
    very easy to get killed standing on a delay cloud since everything spawns without warning. Not noob 
    friendly and still problematic as the survival proceeds. This is where I died on my first playthrough. 
    Near the end (last 20 seconds), there's a lot of crap on the screen and all of it blends in with the 
    background or something else. I just bombed through on my second playthrough. [10/20]
Spell 6: Overall pretty decent, though it's boring at the start and becomes quite chaotic later on due to 
    the graphics, etc. [15/20]

--Screen resolution changer didn't work for me at all. Might be a Wine thing.
--Option Menu - Sound Effect text overlapped with the actual volume number, so it was illegible.
  There were also decimal issues (100.00 vs 100)
--The main problems with your script aesthetically can be summarized as follows: Fade delete, Delay clouds, 
  bullets blend in with everything else.
--Main Menu "Options" is hard to see.
--End of game is quite sudden - you can't even collect the items.</pre>
