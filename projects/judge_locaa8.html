Difficulty: Default

Nonspell 1: Looks pretty, feels simple enough. Can be a little too rainbow visually, but otherwise a solid 
	nonspell. [8/10]
Spell 1: Once again, simple but effective. The multi-layered approach works nicely here. [16/20]
Nonspell 2: Unlike the first nonspell, this one is pretty dynamic, and I like the various components, though 
	some of them don't feel so great (the white bullets, the rainbow on rainbow, etc.) [8/10]
Spell 2: Genius. The way you make the dragon heads and the way they interact with the rest of the spell is 
	fabulous. A very interesting and creative spell with solid, working components. However, it is 
	exceptionally easy to get trapped. [19/20]
Spell 3: Unfortunately, although you have an interesting concept, the micrododge portion of this attack 
	does not work well with the imbalanced directional energy. Requiring precise movement and combining 
	it with a not-entirely-intuitive system does not work particularly well here. It needs to be more 
	obvious how the arrows actually work. [14/20]
Spell 4: A well-thought out multi-layered attack. Each component works well with the other components, with 
	the rings requiring one type of movement and the aimed streams requiring a different type. Feels 
	easier than some of the other attacks but overall quite solid. [17/20]

My Player: GT Medicine A

Difficulty: Default

Nonspell 1: An outstanding multi-phase attack fitting entirely within both the theme and character. 
	Exceptional nonspell design. [10/10]
Spell 1: Can be a complete clusterf*** but overall not shabby. The main problem here is that the lasers 
	cover the other bullets, and make it very hard to tell where the other bullets are - the lasers 
	also happen to be wide enough to hide an amulet underneath. Unfortunately for you, however, you set 
	parameters of the lasers after they have been created. And therefore, I must disqualify this spell.
	[--/--]
Nonspell 2: Another beautiful, in-character, and interesting nonspell. Once again, each portion of the 
	attack works well in conjunction with the others. Maybe a little too blue, but a very good attack. 
	[10/10]
Spell 2: Another well-executed spell, with excellent execution. The delay lasers denoting the water work 
	very well and the water itself is executed quite well. My main complaint here is that, like with the 
	lasers, the water bullets completely obscure the pellets - it's not really possible to pay attention 
	to them since they seem to pop out from beneath the water bullets. [19/20]
Spell 3: A very nice spell, though it feels like a survival. I appreciate the way the colors match up 
	between the lasers and the amulets, and I find the laser patterns to be quite beautiful. Also, the 
	mini-amulets are wonderful. :) However, it starts to feel a little dull near the end since the 
	entire thing doesn't have too much variety in terms of what's being thrown at you. [18/20]

Difficulty: Normal

Nonspell 1: Standard Ran with a twist! Very simple but very nice. [09/10]
Spell 1: Looks nice and the various components work well, but it feels very repetitive and excessively 
	shiny. [16/20]
Nonspell 2: Loos pretty but the BoWaP-ness and excessive rainbow make it feel less great. The angular 
	velocity as a whole feels... off for some reason. [07/10]
Spell 2: Each component works well, but the yellow portion feels very inconsistent and although the spell 
	feels good, it doesn't feel amazing. [17/20]

My Player: Talos MoF Reimu

Difficulty: Normal

Stage Phase 1: The combination of bullets with normal speed and initial negative speed is quite interesting. 
	A fairly standard opener. [04/05]
Stage Phase 2: The pattern created by the first big fairy is quite interesting to see and dodge. Overall, 
	this portion of the stage fits together rather well. The second big fairy has quite the interesting 
	pattern. The big fairies that follow it likewise have interesting variations. [05/05]
Stage Phase 3: The line of bullets produced by the star fairy does add quite a bit to the phase. However, 
	the green fairies take much longer to kill than the big fairies, resulting in a meh flow. [04/05]
Stage Phase 4: The big fairy that fires amulets down can be a little deadly to a first-time player, but 
	otherwise works rather well. The stage portion following with the first big fairy and standard speed 
	aimed bullets flows well as well. [05/05]
Stage Phase 5: Now that you're comnbining various enemy formations, I wonder why you didn't start doing it 
	sooner... [05/05]

Midboss Nonspell: ELLIPSES? BLASPHEMY! SACRILEGE! [09/10]
Midboss Spell: Many phases, some quite... painful. The first ring of delay lasers is not effective at all 
	since there's no reason for them and the player just gets more surprised. I like the various phases 
	to the attack though - they work quite well. [19/20]

Stage Phase 6: And now the bullets are blending in with the clouds. The green kunai and the big fairy's 
	white amulets are very hard to see against that fast white background. Very easy to get cheapshotted 
	or blinded, even though the big fairy's pattern is quite nice. [02/05]

Boss Nonspell 1: Each of the three phases has its own merits. The first is simple and easy to dodge but at 
	the same time interesting. The second is very pretty and looks great overall, while being a cool 
	pattern in general and nice to dodge. The third phase can wall but is overall nice. [09/10]
Boss Spell 1: Mini-suikas! Anyways, the white bullets can be a little hard to see at times, though the 
	flames spawn in a cool pattern. I'd have used a non-white color so that the arrowheads don't blend 
	in with the flames. I also like how every other flame pattern is slightly different in color. [16/20]
Boss Nonspell 2: I do have to say that although the pattern isn't bad, the white bullets look sort of 
	hideous and it's not entirely obvious that the mini-suikas will stop firing - it looks like they'll 
	continue spawning aimed shots until they leave the screen. Also, even though they are hitbox-less, 
	it feels like they will kill you, especially since they die in explosions. [07/10]
Boss Spell 2: With all the effects flying everywhere, it is nearly impossible to tell where things are 
	actually going to spawn. Additionally, the kunai can blend in with the effects, other bullets, and 
	the enemy outer magic circle. Could be vastly improved. [13/20]
Boss Nonspell 3: A fairly solid multi-phase nonspell. Nothing much to say here. [08/10]
Boss Spell 3: There is incredible potential for walling the player. The dense large rings coupled with the 
	dense small rings have a very high probability of walling, and the lasers with red bullets can be 
	lethal, especially since Suika jumps at the player without warning and there isn't much time to 
	prepare for the lasers and red bullet spam. [15/20]
Boss Spell 4: A cool spell, but the aqua portion of the screen (which is very pretty btw) renders above the 
	player hitbox. Additionally, when the round white bullets spawn, they can easily spawn on top of the 
	player without warning or delay. [15/20]
Boss Spell 5: It is completely not obvious what the graze meter is actually doing. Is the graze meter adding 
	bullets? Removing bullets? It's not clear during the spell. Additionally, there is no README to 
	explain this. As a spell though, it's not too bad. Geometric shapes fly everywhere, etc. The end 
	phase (no graze, etc.) is hectic but doable though. So balancing-wise, the spell is great. [16/20]

Difficulty: Default

Nonspell 1: Pretty standard. Not much to say here. Could use some sound effects. [07/10]
Spell 1: This spell is, simply put, super creative and awesome, though it isn't so fun if you don't have a 
	player with homing shots or backwards firing shots. I love the way the waves constrict your movement 
	but at the same time guide you around. The ellipse-style bullets are also nice. [18/20]
Nonspell 2: An interesting and effective nonspell reminiscent of Luminous Dream's Extra Stage. Overall 
	nicely executed and a refreshing twist. Other than that though, it's not particularly interesting. 
	[08/10]
Spell 2: Unlike the previous nonspell, this spell has a number of problems. First is the tendency to wall - 
	it's not always possible to make it out in time. Additionally, the bullets at the bottom of the 
	screen spawn without much delay, and although they spawn based on the position of the anchors 
	(though independently of the anchors), it provides another way for the player to get sandwiched 
	between death and death. An OK attack that could use some work. [15/20]

My Player: Awalys Sanae

Difficulty: Default

Nonspell 1: A fast-paced but overall average nonspell. Not particularly exceptional. [07/10]
Spell 1: It is exceptionally easy to move into the center and get obliterated. Also, when the brighter 
	bullets overlap, it looks sort of weird. Other than that, pretty decent Doremy-like spell. [15/20]
Nonspell 2: A very Doremy-esque attack, and although better than the first nonspell, it is plagued by slow 
	bullets that don't leave the screen fast enough. Not amazing in that regard, but still pretty decent. 
	[07/10]
Spell 2: Unfortunately, by requiring a specific player, you are also expected to test and balance for that 
	player and unfortunately, you have failed at this attack. Doremy's giant blasts are too fast and 
	frequent for Sanae to move out of the way in time. Otherwise, it's an OK attack that doesn't really 
	feel like Doremy for some reason. [13/20]
Nonspell 3: Simple but effective. A solid and rather fun nonspell, though it can be a little... too shiny, 
	like the others. [08/10]
Spell 3: Despite being Border of Wave and Particle, your handling of this attack is interesting the see and 
	play. However, the player is pushed to the bottom of the screen, where its hitbox is not very 
	visible, and the bullets tend to wall quite a bit. [14/20]
Spell 4: ADD rendering errors aside, this doesn't really feel like an attack Doremy would use. As a spell, 
	it's not bad, but it gets very crowded and it's too shiny, which obscures some bullets beneath 
	others. [14/20]

--Love the dialogue!
--Spell meter is not intuitive at all - this is perhaps the biggest issue with your script. It's not a 
  simple matter to figure out whether or not you can bomb, and deathbombing also seems to have some issues 
  (it might just be me)

Nonspell 1: Straightforwards and effective. [07/10]
Spell 1: Overall, a decent spell. I like how the spawner travels inside the walls, and how the lasers seem 
	like they'll wall you but they never do. [17/20]
Nonspell 2: Much more interesting than the first nonspell. I appreciate how the white waves seem like 
	they're going to wall you but they never actually do if you dodge their centers. A dynamic phased 
	nonspell. [09/10]
Spell 2: An interesting and effective attack. I like how the lasers interact. Overall pretty decent, 
	although it's strangely easy to die here for some reason. [16/20]
Nonspell 3: Another simple but effective nonspell. The first phase in particular is quite effective when 
	coupled with the second. [09/10]
Spell 3: It's not intuitive what's going on, which enemy to target, or anything, really. And the bullets 
	form a dense cloud. Sometimes the different components blend well, sometimes... not. A rather RNG 
	dependent attack, though I like their duo purple attack. [16/20]

Nonspell 1: The bullets are red, the background is red, and the white lines on the background are super 
	distracting. Danmakuwise, nothing special. [07/10]
Spell 1: Very red like the first nonspell. I like the first set of bullets, and the lasers work well too. 
	However, the superaccelerating lines of bullets don't work so well if the player is on the sides of 
	the screen since they can get cheapshotted quite easily. [16/20]
Nonspell 2: You're blue now! Solid nonspell. [07/10]
Spell 2: OOOOOOOH THAT LOOKS NICE. I love the way the meteor fires those bullets. The third phase brings 
	things together nicely. [18/20]
Nonspell 3: My eyes are pained looking at that screen. Multiphase nonspell is appreciated but... ugh my 
	eyes. [07/10]
Spell 3: A very nice attack that has been well-thought out. I appreciate how the delay lasers that seem 
	like a laser web explode starting from the top of the screen so that the player will not be 
	cheapshotted. Well-designed attack here. [19/20]
Nonspell 4: I love that ellipse as well as the homing portion, and the colors are easy on the eyes. However, 
	the bullet density is a major step up from the previous nonspells. Still, a good attack. [08/10]
Spell 4: Feels more dangerous than the nonspell but... also falls flat. It's repetitive, feels unsafe since 
	you can't easily tell where the bullets will spawn, and... yeah. Not bad, but not fabulous either. 
	[15/20]
Spell 5: Starts out simple and gets harder as you go along. However, it gradually degernates into a 
	shitstorm of rainbow shiny things falling downwards like rain. Hard to see bullets and generally 
	disappointing. [13/20]

--I miss the shottype previews for the players
--Komachi and Reimu's shots really need to be less shiny
--It was the shininess that ruined the script for me. Your auras make it hard to tell shots apart, 
  especially with your players. I don't know why it's an issue with this script and not the others.
--I like your color theme, with the nonspells and spells paired for a given color, as well as the 
  similarities shared between their danmaku.</pre>

Nonspell 1: I love the rings but the large crystal bullets don't work as nicely from a visual perspective. 
	I do love the spawn pattern though! [08/10]
Spell 1: Simple but effective. I like how your take some very basic patterns and make a solid and visually 
	appealing spellcard with them. [17/20]
Nonspell 2: I like the way you handle the phases of this attack and especially like those bullets at the 
	end. The first phase can be a little... crowded, but the other two phases work nicely to deliver a 
	solid nonspell. [08/10]
Spell 2: Those laser wings are amazing but it's not always clear where the safe range is. The arrows and 
	bubbles work well, though the arrows, like the large crystals, don't look so great (the sprites). 
	Danmaku-wise, very nice but has some quirks with Alice's movement and not really knowing where to 
	stay safe. [18/20]
Spell 3: I love the way you handle this spell and the three types of lasers. The first phase is solid and 
	very likable. The second is interesting but does NOT work when Alice moves - the entire laser 
	suddenly seems to change targets and that's not a good thing. The final part looks great and is 
	pretty cool to dodge. [19/20]

Nonspell 1: Standard Ringo, with a little twist! That last wave can be a little... cheap though. [07/10]
Spell 1: A simple spell, with clear warnings and fair danmaku. Not the most interesting stuff, but a solid 
	spell. [16/20]
Nonspell 2: A lot nicer than the first nonspell in terms of flow, but still feels a little... meh. Also, 
	the transition from red to blue doesn't look very smooth. [07/10]
Spell 2: ATTACK OF THE DANGOMAKU. But no, seriously. The dangomaku is excellent. It's creative and the 
	phased nature of this spell is quite effective, with the criss-crossing dango sticks. Also, those 
	Junko rings are so very appropriate. [20/20]
Nonspell 3: This time the large purple bullets are the stupidly fast ones. More of the same. Thankfully 
	they're Junko style and every other wave has the same angle. [07/10]
Spell 3: I like the way the opener works as well as the bullet spawning at the edges of the circles, but 
	that giant wall of white bullets is a little fast. However, the main complaint is that it doesn't 
	initially seem like it will expand to cover so much range and can easily cheapshot a player. 
	Thankfully dodging inside the big circle is a thing... and it sort of makes the spell super easy. 
	Way too easy. Needs some balancing. [16/20]
Spell 4: Whelp giant BoWaP dangomaku. Followed by standard dangomaku while forcing the player to loop 
	around. And then there's just walls of flour enclosing the player in death. Overall not bad, but 
	some parts are a little overkill, especially the end. [16/20]

Difficulty: Normal

Nonspell 1: A solid and visually pleasing nonspell. I like how the bubbles and small green bullets work 
	together with the bullet lines. [09/10]
Spell 1: Black lines on the flowers aside, this spell is pretty decent. The first phase is pretty solid and 
	I like the second phase, although it lasts a little too long for my taste. The third phase is also 
	pretty good. However, it still feels meh at best, though it's effective. [17/20]
Nonspell 2: Looks interesting but the blue doesn't fit Yuuka and neither does the rainbow. Additionally, my 
	ears are pained by those bullet spawn sound effects. [07/10]
Spell 2: While it's quite a nice spell, it takes way too long for the player to learn what the disappearing 
	flowers actually do - your big mistake was firing the second wave of flowers before the player could 
	learn what the first wave did. There's also quite a lot of visual noise when the bullets appear - 
	the charge effect coupled with that background and the flowers makes things hard to see and overall 
	less effective. [15/20]

--You have a crapton of poorly-handled (0,0) spawning issues. If the boss's lifebar is gone, sound 
  effects for bullet spawning should not play, and the bullets shouldn't even have a delay cloud at (0,0). 
--The spell background rotates very quickly and is very distracting (and slightly dizzying)

Difficulty: Extra

Nonspell 1: Interesting but can be very unfair if you're close to where the bullets form mega walls. Overall 
	dull. [07/10]
Spell 1: No room to maneuver or see where the bullets are coming if you're at the bottom of the screen, and 
	my ears hurt. No variety either. In this case, the sound situation is so bad even without the music 
	that even if the danmaku was interesting, it wouldn't get a good score. [11/20]
Nonspell 2: Once again, my ears hurt. Also, this attack is almost guaranteed to kill you since the fast 
	bullets like to cover the gaps in the slower bullets. And then you have the super slow bullets. And 
	the entire thing is blue bullets on a blue background. [3/10]
Spell 2: Painful sound effects aside, this attack is pretty decent. I like the way you have bullets from 
	above and below. [16/20]
Nonspell 3: Like the first nonspell but instead of being cheap, it's exceptionally boring, even moreso than 
	the first nonspell. [06/10]
Spell 3: The yellow fireballs are hard to see on the spell background, you can stay inside the moons and 
	avoid the stars, and the entire spell feels like it's running at 20 FPS because of how dense and 
	slow everything is. Disappointing. [13/20]
Spell 4: Dense, not fun. That basically covers the blue phase. The green phase would be nice except that 
	the angular velocity makes everything form a wall. It's not bad, but it's not fun, and it just drags 
	on. The red phase is likewise a drag. [8/20]
Spell 5: Hurts my eyes, Hecatia's bullets (first wave) are cool but the angular velocity makes them very 
	unfair. It's so slight that it doesn't add much while at the same time making it exponentially 
	harder to dodge Clownpiece's rings. Did I mention the sound effects? However, then you have the 
	lasers, which burn your eyes but are better... and then the yellow stars that blend in with the 
	background and are super shiny. Shiny does not equal good. [8/20]

Comments
--Please do not use .mp3 files for music. I was unable to play your script with the bgm.
--It is advised that you do not hide parts of the story depending on the difficulty.
--I know that you forced a certain player, but those who haven't used this player (which is VERY recent) 
  before may not know how to bomb with it - especially the fact that you need to manually restock your 
  ammo. This did not work in your favor.
--I find it difficult to get past the second nonspell with all of the lives, so I overrode your player 
  with one of my debug mode players in order to actually play the rest of the script.
--Also, what's up with the super large lifebars on your attacks? An extra stage nonspell should last 10
  seconds tops, and many Touhou spellcards can be cleared in under 20 seconds.. It takes half a minute to 
  clear one of your nonspells.
--Your script ruined my good mood.</pre>

Difficulty: Contest

Nonspell 1: Pretty solid, very much Flandre. I like the way the two components work together. [08/10]
Spell 1: I really like how each part of the spell works - the bullets created by the lasers initially 
	restrict, but then cause the player to move, especially when the other bullets arrive, and then 
	the explosions add quite a bit more depth to the spell. Nice job. [19/20]
Nonspell 2: I like the way you handle this nonspell, with the lines and knives. It works quite well, 
	especially the phased approach. [10/10]
Spell 2: I love the way the spell is designed, with the rings keeping you on your toes while the blasts 
	making you move. It looks great and plays great. My only gripe is the very first ring of bullets, 
	which can spawn lower than expected. [19/20]
Nonspell 3: The shimmering arrowheads do not work well graphically - they distract from everything else. 
	Overall solid but not the best. [07/10]
Spell 3: I like how the layers in this attack work, with the restrictive web as well as rings and spirals. 
	Each component does a good job. [18/20]
Spell 4: I love this spell. The way it works is simple and very easy to understand, and the execution is 
	very good. I also appreciate that if you mess you the first few times, you can still squeeze 
	between the blasts. Very simple yet very well designed. Later phases can be a little painful 
	though. [20/20]
Spell 5: So starting off, this is awesome... until you accidentally confuse the lasers with the design on 
	the spell background that has the same colors (red and black) as the actual lasers... Anyways, I 
	love this spell, especially the gigantic screen-covering blast phase. There's quite a lot to this 
	spell, and the only real complaint outside of that laser issue is the delay lasers that only seem 
	to have aesthetic purpose (the bullets they warn you against are slowish). [20/20]

Difficulty: Easy

Attack 1: Pretty simple attack here. I like the arrows, but the talismans aren't particularly distinct 
	against the background. Too much blur. That said, a solid nonspell. [08/10]
Attack 2: Everything is fine until the amulets begin to cover up the dark purple bullets. The talismans 
	themselves are pretty good but the transition can be cheap due to the high probability of being 
	walled. [08/10]
Attack 3: First part is challenging but effective. And then the transition is pretty terrible. There's a 
	pretty high chance of the gap between the long strings being blocked by leftover bullets from 
	before. A pretty nice attack though in general - that one transition aside, everything's pretty 
	good. [09/10]
Attack 4: OK this isn't fair at all, since the gap between the first two waves is nearly nonexistent. The 
	phase after the first starts off amazing and then shoves you against the sides of the screen where 
	you die. Not fun. Third phase is chaotic but fair. [06/10]
Attack 5: First phase is pretty cool and I like it. Second phase is also pretty nice. Third phase is a 
	clear reminder that this is Reimu... but those orbs really don't like to move. [07/10]
Attack 6: First phase is pretty solid. Second phase is also solid but feels unusually ordinary. The third 
	phase can easily cause death and isn't wonderful to dodge. Fourth phase is solid. [07/10]
Attack 7: That opener looks awesome. Same for second phase. There is, however, a high chance of walling.

Difficulty: Default

Nonspell 1: Solid danmaku, looks good, and quite effective. Pacing feels a little off due to not syncing 
	with music, and there's a long delay between waves. [08/10]
Spell 1: Nice job here, though the ring of medium bullets is so dense that it can be very hard to avoid 
	getting walled, depending on the RNG. A likable spell though, and I love the crystal spawn pattern. 
	[19/20]
Nonspell 2: Another solid nonspell, with good flow and nice danmaku. [09/10]
Spell 2: It is exceptionally easy to get cheapshotted by the blasts here. Without knowing beforehand that 
	they will launch halfway across the screen and annihilate everything, it really isn't possible to 
	avoid. Still, I like the spell, and if you avoid the blasts, it's a pretty cool attack. [16/20]
Nonspell 3: An attractive phased spell, until the angular velocity fireballs merge with the bubbles and 
	kill you. It's obviously intentional, so I'm afraid that I'm going to have to deduct points for 
	that. Having hard-to-see bullets using angular velocity in a mess of shiny bubbles is not amazing. 
	[07/10]
Spell 3: A super cool and well-thought out spell. I love how the magic circles look and work - it's very 
	nice. However, you messed up by not putting spell resist on important bullets. Dying will result 
	in the entire screen being empty for around 5 whole seconds. [17/20]
Spell 4: A pretty solid spell, though getting trapped anywhere other than in the middle means that you 
	might not be able to do much of anything. [17/20]

Midboss Nonspell: Stars out simple and then out come the pretty pretty lines of fireballs oscillating in 
	unison. Very nice... until you get brutally murdered via actual wall of fireballs. Also, what's 
	up with that insanely long health bar? I beat it with like 7 seconds left on the timer. [07/10]
Midboss Spell: I want to like this attack and some of the components are really nice. However, all of the 
	nice things end up blending in with the background and making it hard to see stuff. [16/20]

Nonspell 1: OOH THAT'S PRETTY I APPROVE I LIKE... except dodging the blue talisman waves while weaving 
	through the pink ones is not particularly easy. [08/10]
Spell 1: The lasers flying upwards are 1000x more interesting than the lasers coming down at the player. 
	However, Nue's swarm of blue bullets is sort of cool. Just that the lasers aren't [16/20]
Nonspell 2: This nonspell is quite good. I adore the way you treat the talismans, and although the red 
	bullets don't look amazing graphically, they work nicely here. [09/10]
Spell 2: You cover the screen in... stuff. Not... too wonderful. Especially since the blue lasers like to 
	blend in with the background. There's a lot of stuff going on here and it's just... too much. 
	Danmaku-wise, it's not terrible, but it's not outstanding in any way, shape, or form. 
	Disappointingly average. [15/20]
Nonspell 3: Attack of the pretty amulets! They tend to shove you towards one of the sides of the screen 
	but otherwise it's a pretty nice nonspell. [08/10]
Spell 3: A solid spell, though also disappointingly average. So little happens here until you take one of 
	them out. The UFO's solo is... eeeeeh. Not interesting and not fun. Just fast bullets without 
	much of a gap between them. [15/20]
Spell 4: Not fun. It's just aimedish bullets for some time that can't be seen since the fog covers up the 
	timer. It's repetitive and bland. [14/20]
Spell 5: The first phase is disappointing. And then you proceed to cover the screen in white bullets. 
	While the later phases aren't bad, they're... average. In the end the spell is just lasers 
	everywhere with nice patterns in between. [15/20]

Spell 1: The phoenixes cover an incredible part of the screen and easily wall. However, it's a decent spell 
	overall. [16/20]
Nonspell 2: Looks and plays quite nice. I love how the flames look as well as how they work with the 
	talismans. [10/10]
Spell 2: The talismans can be incredible hard to spot over all of the other stuff on the screen. Other than 
	that, looks pretty decent. [16/20]
Nonspell 3: Unlike the previous nonspells, this one feels out of character - rainbow knives don't really fit 
	Mokou very well in this scenario. The danmaku isn't bad, but isn't fabulous either. [07/10]
Spell 3: Overall, not a bad spell but feels very underwhelming, and bullets can come from below. [15/20]
Spell 4: There's a lot of visual noise in this survival. Overall very chaotic and not fun. [13/20]
Spell 5: 20 FPS yay. All I see is red bullets that form a nice cage as well as rainbows everywhere. 
	Disappointing and laggy. [14/20]

Comments
--Your 'Lives' and 'Spellcard' text have weird black lines on them
--Text is hard to read
--You decided to use an expanded screen but did not change certain parts of your script (e.g. End Scene) 
  to work with that expanded screen.
--Having Mokou be immune to all damage while there's a player bomb is very frustrating, although I 
  understand why you did it.
--There is a lot of visual noise in this script, with all of the text and the disappearing player sprite 
  and all kinds of other things
--I can't get past Spell 3 on a normal run.
--Mokou has enormous lifebars... or rather, during spells, she moves around all the time and her hitbox
  is around 2/3 what I'm used to (radius of 24 instead of 36)
--Runs around 40 FPS for me.</pre>

Nonspell 1: Simple, yet surprisingly challenging and fun. Solid attack here. [08/10]
Spell 1: I love the fireballs here, and the way the knives and fireballs work together is quite effective. 
	Shikieiki's standard blast also works well, though the last wave of blue knives can be a little 
	too slow. Nice job. [18/20]
Nonspell 2: I love the blue and red spawn patterns, and the aimed bullets add quite a bit of fun to the 
	dodging. Overall a solid and effective nonspell. [09/10]
Spell 2: The various components work rather well together, and it's both fair and someone challenging to 
	dodge, which is very good. Doesn't feel like Shikieiki for some reason but a solid spell. [16/20]
Spell 3: Overall a rather simple but effective spell. I love how the red and blue bubbles overlap to form 
	purple, and how the restriction on the screen encourages macrododging as well as redirecting the 
	blast. Nice job here. [17/20]

--The difficulty is absolutely perfect. It's on the verge of being a little too hard for general purposes

Nonspell 1: The stars are sort of fast and the pattern doesn't feel very Clownpiece, and the lasers are... 
	eh. But not bad. [07/10]
Spell 1: While I like the way the fireballs spawn, this pattern... feels average. [15/20]
Nonspell 2: Definitely a pretty attack, but the aqua fireballs doing have that MURICA oomph I was expecting. 
	[08/10]
Spell 2: Forcing players to dodge through those tiny gaps in order to avoid getting shoved into the bottom 
	right corner ruins whatever this spell offered. As a reminder, most players probably won't try to 
	stick between two lasers (the gap is only a few pixels wide) and it is super easy to get 
	cheapshotted in that situation. [10/20]

Nonspell 1: Standard Raiko. Can be a little hard but overall quite nice. [08/10]
Spell 1: I like the spell and how the phases work. The curvy lasers work nicely, as do the yellow arrow 
	formations. Sound effects are, however, near-inaudible. Which is a shame, because they work so 
	well with the spellcard. [18/20]
Nonspell 2: Another solid nonspell. I love how the faster arrow formations are narrower, so they never 
	wall you. Well-designed and quite nice to play. Also, PENTAGONS. [09/10]
Spell 2: This spell looks amazing but the timing between waves is a little painful. Also, it feels very 
	empty as an attack. [16/20]
Nonspell 3: I love the mini-formations as well as the phasing and colors used in this nonspell. It works 
	really well as a whole. [10/10]
Spell 3: An interesting and rather well-executed spell, though the fast arrow formations seem to not be 
	spell-immune. [18/20]
Spell 4: I absolutely love the way the first wave of purple notes spawn - it looks great. And as the 
	layers stack up, you have a very attractive spell, both when dodging and when watching the bullets 
	themselves. It gets crazy near the end but that's part of the fun, I guess. [18/20]

Nonspell 1: Pretty standard Kaguya. Works well visually and when dodging. Starts a little too quickly 
	though. [08/10]
Spell 1: A solid spell with components from above and from the sides. My main complaint here is that some 
	bullets blend in with the background - the arrowheads also tend to become invisible on the magic 
	circle. [17/20]
Nonspell 2: I would have preferred that the bullets of every other wave do something different, but oh well. 
	Also, staying above Kaguya sort of cheaps the attack if you have a homing player. [7/10]
Spell 2: You might want to tone down those sound effects a bit but danmaku-wise, a solid spell that's rather 
	interesting to play. I like how the restricted playing area works as well. [17/20]
Nonspell 3: Another solid nonspell. I like how the spawning of the pellets works in conjunction with the 
	yellow bullets' speed. [08/10]
Spell 3: I love how this spell looks and works but the spell disintegrates into 'stay in the area inside the 
	sine wave' and then the entire thing becomes super boring. Also, very high tendency to wall. [16/20]
Nonspell 4: Another very Kaguya-esque nonspell. Rather effective though boring. [07/10]
Spell 4: Another attractive attack similar to Nonspell 3. However, dodging is extremely simple and it's a 
	little too shiny overall for my tastes. [16/20]
Spell 5: An extremely claustrophobic spell. Not bad, but very shiny and very slow. It's just the random 
	round balls that are the problem though - the other components are fine. Later phases are slightly 
	better in this regard since there's less shiny stuff in a packed area. My main complaint, however, 
	is how long the survival is. [16/20]
Spell 6: Ugh, shiny bullets that blend into the background. Unfortunately, it's just... not amazing. [14/20]
