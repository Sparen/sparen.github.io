My Player: A2 Marisa

Difficulty: Default

Nonspell 1: Looks pretty, feels simple enough. Can be a little too rainbow visually, but otherwise a solid 
	nonspell. [8/10]
Spell 1: Once again, simple but effective. The multi-layered approach works nicely here. [16/20]
Nonspell 2: Unlike the first nonspell, this one is pretty dynamic, and I like the various components, though 
	some of them don't feel so great (the white bullets, the rainbow on rainbow, etc.) [8/10]
Spell 2: Genius. The way you make the dragon heads and the way they interact with the rest of the spell is 
	fabulous. A very interesting and creative spell with solid, working components. However, it is 
	exceptionally easy to get trapped. [19/20]
Spell 3: Unfortunately, although you have an interesting concept, the micrododge portion of this attack 
	does not work well with the imbalanced directional energy. Requiring precise movement and combining 
	it with a not-entirely-intuitive system does not work particularly well here. It needs to be more 
	obvious how the arrows actually work. [14/20]
Spell 4: A well-thought out multi-layered attack. Each component works well with the other components, with 
	the rings requiring one type of movement and the aimed streams requiring a different type. Feels 
	easier than some of the other attacks but overall quite solid. [17/20]

My Player: GT Medicine A

Difficulty: Default

Nonspell 1: An outstanding multi-phase attack fitting entirely within both the theme and character. 
	Exceptional nonspell design. [10/10]
Spell 1: Can be a complete clusterf*** but overall not shabby. The main problem here is that the lasers 
	cover the other bullets, and make it very hard to tell where the other bullets are - the lasers 
	also happen to be wide enough to hide an amulet underneath. Unfortunately for you, however, you set 
	parameters of the lasers after they have been created. And therefore, I must disqualify this spell.
	[--/--]
Nonspell 2: Another beautiful, in-character, and interesting nonspell. Once again, each portion of the 
	attack works well in conjunction with the others. Maybe a little too blue, but a very good attack. 
	[10/10]
Spell 2: Another well-executed spell, with excellent execution. The delay lasers denoting the water work 
	very well and the water itself is executed quite well. My main complaint here is that, like with the 
	lasers, the water bullets completely obscure the pellets - it's not really possible to pay attention 
	to them since they seem to pop out from beneath the water bullets. [19/20]
Spell 3: A very nice spell, though it feels like a survival. I appreciate the way the colors match up 
	between the lasers and the amulets, and I find the laser patterns to be quite beautiful. Also, the 
	mini-amulets are wonderful. :) However, it starts to feel a little dull near the end since the 
	entire thing doesn't have too much variety in terms of what's being thrown at you. [18/20]

Difficulty: Normal

Nonspell 1: Standard Ran with a twist! Very simple but very nice. [09/10]
Spell 1: Looks nice and the various components work well, but it feels very repetitive and excessively 
	shiny. [16/20]
Nonspell 2: Loos pretty but the BoWaP-ness and excessive rainbow make it feel less great. The angular 
	velocity as a whole feels... off for some reason. [07/10]
Spell 2: Each component works well, but the yellow portion feels very inconsistent and although the spell 
	feels good, it doesn't feel amazing. [17/20]

My Player: Talos MoF Reimu

Difficulty: Normal

Stage Phase 1: The combination of bullets with normal speed and initial negative speed is quite interesting. 
	A fairly standard opener. [04/05]
Stage Phase 2: The pattern created by the first big fairy is quite interesting to see and dodge. Overall, 
	this portion of the stage fits together rather well. The second big fairy has quite the interesting 
	pattern. The big fairies that follow it likewise have interesting variations. [05/05]
Stage Phase 3: The line of bullets produced by the star fairy does add quite a bit to the phase. However, 
	the green fairies take much longer to kill than the big fairies, resulting in a meh flow. [04/05]
Stage Phase 4: The big fairy that fires amulets down can be a little deadly to a first-time player, but 
	otherwise works rather well. The stage portion following with the first big fairy and standard speed 
	aimed bullets flows well as well. [05/05]
Stage Phase 5: Now that you're comnbining various enemy formations, I wonder why you didn't start doing it 
	sooner... [05/05]

Midboss Nonspell: ELLIPSES? BLASPHEMY! SACRILEGE! [09/10]
Midboss Spell: Many phases, some quite... painful. The first ring of delay lasers is not effective at all 
	since there's no reason for them and the player just gets more surprised. I like the various phases 
	to the attack though - they work quite well. [19/20]

Stage Phase 6: And now the bullets are blending in with the clouds. The green kunai and the big fairy's 
	white amulets are very hard to see against that fast white background. Very easy to get cheapshotted 
	or blinded, even though the big fairy's pattern is quite nice. [02/05]

Boss Nonspell 1: Each of the three phases has its own merits. The first is simple and easy to dodge but at 
	the same time interesting. The second is very pretty and looks great overall, while being a cool 
	pattern in general and nice to dodge. The third phase can wall but is overall nice. [09/10]
Boss Spell 1: Mini-suikas! Anyways, the white bullets can be a little hard to see at times, though the 
	flames spawn in a cool pattern. I'd have used a non-white color so that the arrowheads don't blend 
	in with the flames. I also like how every other flame pattern is slightly different in color. [16/20]
Boss Nonspell 2: I do have to say that although the pattern isn't bad, the white bullets look sort of 
	hideous and it's not entirely obvious that the mini-suikas will stop firing - it looks like they'll 
	continue spawning aimed shots until they leave the screen. Also, even though they are hitbox-less, 
	it feels like they will kill you, especially since they die in explosions. [07/10]
Boss Spell 2: With all the effects flying everywhere, it is nearly impossible to tell where things are 
	actually going to spawn. Additionally, the kunai can blend in with the effects, other bullets, and 
	the enemy outer magic circle. Could be vastly improved. [13/20]
Boss Nonspell 3: A fairly solid multi-phase nonspell. Nothing much to say here. [08/10]
Boss Spell 3: There is incredible potential for walling the player. The dense large rings coupled with the 
	dense small rings have a very high probability of walling, and the lasers with red bullets can be 
	lethal, especially since Suika jumps at the player without warning and there isn't much time to 
	prepare for the lasers and red bullet spam. [15/20]
Boss Spell 4: A cool spell, but the aqua portion of the screen (which is very pretty btw) renders above the 
	player hitbox. Additionally, when the round white bullets spawn, they can easily spawn on top of the 
	player without warning or delay. [15/20]
Boss Spell 5: It is completely not obvious what the graze meter is actually doing. Is the graze meter adding 
	bullets? Removing bullets? It's not clear during the spell. Additionally, there is no README to 
	explain this. As a spell though, it's not too bad. Geometric shapes fly everywhere, etc. The end 
	phase (no graze, etc.) is hectic but doable though. So balancing-wise, the spell is great. [16/20]
