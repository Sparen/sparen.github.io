	      <h2 style="color:red">AAA Contest: Nuclear Hell Raven</h2>
	      <p>Release Date: May 4, 2014</p>
	      <p>Official Post: <a target="_blank" href=https://www.shrinemaiden.org/forum/index.php/topic,13738.msg1091346.html#msg1091346">Click Here for Information and Download</a></p>

	      <p>A sharp contrast from my other ph3 scripts, this script ranks more like my Sekibanki battle - it has an amazing background and amazing music but the danmaku is about as unimaginative and uninspiringly unoriginal as it gets. I don't understand how something this mediocre managed to co-win third place in a contest, but whatever. It was also pretty hard to replicate Satori's nonspell (I failed). In the end, my Suiroga and Virtue of Wind God cameos were what dragged this script down. Well, at least I know not to try those again... Too much ADD rendering. (The positive thing is that the sun code here has stayed with me ever since. If you like tasks with 20 parameters, that code is for you.)</p>
	      <h2 style="color:yellow">Artifact Contest 2: Of Celestials and Master Sparks</h2>
	      <p>Release Date: April 10, 2014</p>
	      <p>Official Post: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.shrinemaiden.org/forum/index.php/topic,13738.msg1079959.html#msg1079959">Click Here for Information and Download</a></p>

	      <p>Extremely depressingly bad stage portion aside, this script was one of my better ones. It contains (surprisingly) one of my best in-game dialogues ever (midboss), and is surprisingly fun. And although it wasn't amazingly fun to make like some of the other scripts, it came out pretty good, so I can't complain.</p>
	      <h2 style="color:yellow">Artifact Contest 2 Marisa Player</h2>
	      <p>Release Date: March 5, 2014</p>
	      <p>Download Link: <a target="_blank" href="http://adf.ly/v81Dk">Link (AdFly)</a></p>
	      <p>Arguably the best player I have made in terms of usability. Made to accompany the Artifact 2 Contest, it ended up being my primary player for more than half a year afterwards. The bomb is Sanae-ish, but not really at the same time.</p>
	      <h2 style="color:violet">Digital Earth Conquest Flamon and Strabimon Player Scripts</h2>
	      <p>Release Date: Indeterminate</p>
	      <p>My Flamon and Strabimon player scripts were some of my best in terms of originality - most of shots and graphics were my own, and the players remain as a fluffy and heartwarming reminder of how far Digital Earth: Conquest has come. They were one of my great leaps of faith - they were the step into the world of CommonData for me.</p>
	      <h2 style="color:salmon">Danmaku Dodging for Dummies ph3</h2>
	      <p>Release Date: March 15, 2014</p>
	      <p>Official Post: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.shrinemaiden.org/forum/index.php/topic,13738.msg1059848.html#msg1059848">Click Here for Information and Download</a></p>
	      <p>DDDph3 was the spiritual and actual successor to my 0.12m version. It was significantly, significantly improved, and was when I learned about implementing my own fonts (Danmakufu changed default fonts multiple times). Caught in the rough transition between ph3 [.0 pre23] and ph3 [.1 pre2], it nevertheless pulled through and, although not as easy as it could have been, remains a viable and legitimate tool for those aiming to learn to dodge danmaku. However, Digital Earth: Conquest came and this project never got completed.</p>
	      <h2 style="color:orange">LOCAA Contest 4: Death Match in the Skies</h2>
	      <p>Release Date: January 29, 2014</p>
	      <p>Official Post: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.shrinemaiden.org/forum/index.php/topic,13738.msg1049520.html#msg1049520">Click Here for Information and Download</a></p>

	      <p>My LOCAA 4 Contest entry was my first plural in ph3 and, surprisingly, remains one of my best scripts. It was optimized for one version but had to be re-released twice because Danmakufu was updated to a new version featuring Unicode support. Relatively well balanced, interesting, and quite original, with spins on existing nonspells.</p>	      <h2 style="color:aqua">Kogasa-Utsuho Player Script</h2>	      <p>Release Date: December 31, 2013</p>
	      <p>Download Link: <a target="_blank" href="http://adf.ly/v81AD">Link (AdFly)</a></p>
	      <p>This was the player for my LOCAA 4 contest entry as well as my primary player script for ph3 before Artifact 2 Marisa was made. It was basically a merged and improved version of my Kogasa and Utsuho players, with all original player sprites. Once again, I was somewhat stupid and began a new language with a player script.</p>	      <br>            </div>          </div>        </div>      </div>      <footer>        <p style="text-align: center;"><a href="#top">Top</a></p>        <p style="text-align: center;">Copyright Â© 2014-2015 by Andrew Fan</p>        <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Other            Sites/Affiliates</span></p>        <div style="text-align: center;"><a target="_blank" href="http://www.winehq.org"><img	      alt="&quot;Wine HQ&quot;"	      src="../images/afflogowinehq.png"></a>          <a target="_blank" href="http://www.shrinemaiden.org/forum/index.php"><img	      alt="&quot;Maidens of the Kaleidoscope&quot;"	      src="../images/afflogomotk.png"></a>          <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bulletforge.org"><img alt="&quot;Bulletforge&quot;"	      src="../images/afflogobulletforge.png"></a>          <a target="_blank" href="http://moriyashrine.weebly.com/index.html"><img	      alt="&quot;Moriya Shrine&quot;"	      src="../images/afflogomoriyashrine.png"></a>        </div>      </footer>    </div>  </body></html>
