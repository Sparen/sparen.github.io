These include projects from the start of my time working with ph3 to the 2015 hiatus when I was working on SeitenTouji AMB, including the Digital Earth: Conquest project.</p>
	      <h2 style="color:deepskyblue">Incident Causer Mayhem Contest: The Avatar of Mountains and Lakes</h2>
	      <p><a href="./projectsphase4_icm.html">LINK TO PAGE</a></p>
	      <h2 style="color:mediumspringgreen">LOCAA Contest 6: Danmakufu Troll Stars</h2>
	      <p><a href="./projectsphase4_locaa6.html">LINK TO PAGE</a></p>
	      <h2 style="color:red">AAA Contest: Nuclear Hell Raven</h2>
	      <p><a href="./projectsphase3_aaa.html">LINK TO PAGE</a></p>
	      <h2 style="color:yellow">Artifact Contest 2: Of Celestials and Master Sparks</h2>
	      <p><a href="./projectsphase3_artifact2.html">LINK TO PAGE</a></p>
	      <h2 style="color:yellow">Artifact Contest 2 Marisa Player</h2>
	      <p>Release Date: March 5, 2014</p>
	      <p>Download Link: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bulletforge.org/u/sparen/p/marisa-player-artifact-2">Link</a></p>
	      <p>Arguably the best player I have made in terms of usability. Made to accompany the Artifact 2 Contest, it ended up being my primary player for more than half a year afterwards. The bomb is Sanae-ish, but not really at the same time.</p>
	      <h2 style="color:violet">Digital Earth Conquest Flamon and Strabimon Player Scripts</h2>
	      <p>Release Date: Indeterminate</p>
	      <p>My Flamon and Strabimon player scripts were some of my best in terms of originality - most of shots and graphics were my own, and the players remain as a fluffy and heartwarming reminder of how far Digital Earth: Conquest has come. They were one of my great leaps of faith - they were the step into the world of CommonData for me.</p>
	      <h2 style="color:salmon">Danmaku Dodging for Dummies ph3</h2>
	      <p>Release Date: March 15, 2014</p>
	      <p>Official Post: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.shrinemaiden.org/forum/index.php/topic,13738.msg1059848.html#msg1059848">Click Here for Information and Download</a></p>
	      <p>DDDph3 was the spiritual and actual successor to my 0.12m version. It was significantly, significantly improved, and was when I learned about implementing my own fonts (Danmakufu changed default fonts multiple times). Caught in the rough transition between ph3 [.0 pre23] and ph3 [.1 pre2], it nevertheless pulled through and, although not as easy as it could have been, remains a viable and legitimate tool for those aiming to learn to dodge danmaku. However, Digital Earth: Conquest came and this project never got completed.</p>
	      <h2 style="color:orange">LOCAA Contest 4: Death Match in the Skies</h2>
	      <p><a href="./projectsphase3_locaa4.html">LINK TO PAGE</a></p>	      <h2 style="color:aqua">Kogasa-Utsuho Player Script</h2>	      <p>Release Date: December 31, 2013</p>
	      <p>Download Link: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bulletforge.org/u/sparen/p/kogasa-okuu-player-script">Link</a></p>
	      <p>This was the player for my LOCAA 4 contest entry as well as my primary player script for ph3 before Artifact 2 Marisa was made. It was basically a merged and improved version of my Kogasa and Utsuho players, with all original player sprites. Once again, I was somewhat stupid and began a new language with a player script.</p>	      <br>          </div>      </div>      <footer>        <p style="text-align: center;"><a href="#top">Top</a></p>        <p style="text-align: center;">Copyright Â© 2014-2019 by Andrew Fan</p>        <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Other            Sites/Affiliates</span></p>        <div style="text-align: center;">          <a target="_blank" href="http://www.shrinemaiden.org/forum/index.php"><img	      alt="&quot;Maidens of the Kaleidoscope&quot;"	      src="../images/afflogomotk.png"></a>          <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bulletforge.org"><img alt="&quot;Bulletforge&quot;"	      src="../images/afflogobulletforge.png"></a>        </div>      </footer>    </div>  </body></html>
