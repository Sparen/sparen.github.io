	      <h2 style="color:yellow;text-shadow:2px 2px orange;font-size:18px;font-weight: normal;">GAMEPLAY AND SYNOPSIS</h2>
	      <p>In PokéDigiDanmaku, the player follows Veemon on his journey through the mysterious unknown world that lies before him, during which he meets some interesting characters and looks for a way home.</p>
	      <p>PokéDigiDanmaku is a 6 Stage + Extra Touhou-esque vertically scrolling shmup featuring Veemon as the player character. Veemon is able to swap between different forms, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, and this is the key to the game. There are six base difficulties (Very Easy, Easy, Normal, Hard, Lunatic, and Overdrive).</p>
	      <p>Note that as this is an older project, it lacks proper difficulty balancing and can be unnecessarily hard at certain points. Stage 4's boss forms depend on the difficulty being played.</p>

              <blockquote><span style="font-size:24px; color:yellow">POKÉDIGIDANMAKU HAS BEEN COMPLETED!</span><br>
<br>
Today is December 25, 2013, and I am proud to release PokéDigiDanmaku.<br>
<br>
This release is the culmination of one year and three months work. This project was started on September 28, 2012 in NetLogo 5.0.2. Work began on the player December 17, 2013. Thanks to Drake, Lunasa, and Helepolis, the player script was completed. Work began on the actual game February 19, 2013 and has continued on to this day. <br>
<br>
A full list of credits can be found within the PokéDigiDanmaku v2.## directory inside the script folder of the release package. However, I would like to spend a brief moment thanking those who contributed most to this project, in no particular order.<br>
<br>
CK Crash/Onthenet, Drake, gtbot, Helepolis, Hunguil, Miransu/Victini/Mewkyuu, Neito/Ikaruneko, Ozzy/ExPorygon, PhantomSong, Shiizendame Hoshiteru, Spectral Nexus, TalosMistake, Trickysticks, TrollTrain<br>
<br>
Additional code credits go to the following:<br>
Professor Scissors and Shockman<br>
<br>
Additional graphics credits go to the following:<br>
Feilarco666, YuniNaoki, The Pokémon Company, The Last Comer staff, Digimon, ZUN<br>
<br>
And of course, the professors who inspired me and helped me (probably) without knowing about the existence of this project or their role in it<br>
Mr. Brown-Mykolyk, Mr. Cocoros, Mr. Konstantinovich, and Mr. Usoroh<br>
<br>
This project has been my gateway into Danmakufu. Three major scripts of mine have been published during its time based on the existing system, my LOCAA Contest 3 entry, my RaNGE Contest 10 Entry, and my Halloween Contest Entry. The first of the three formed the basis of the Extra Stage Boss of PokéDigiDanmaku. The second formed the basis of the stage background code for Stage 5 of PokéDigiDanmaku.<br>
<br>
And so, the download link on Bulletforge: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bulletforge.org/u/sparen/p/pokdigidanmaku-alpha">Download</a><br>
<br>
Please note two things. Firstly, this come with Danmakufu pre-packaged. Secondly, the download link for the music can be found in the Bulletforge version description. Please note that all of the music is from Pokémon, and that I need to deliver a shoutout to the fabulous composers that made the original soundtracks (which I have edited accordingly). An especially large shoutout goes to Arata Iiyoshi, Tsukasa Tawada, and Shinichiro Nakamura, who, as far as my sources say, composed the music for Pokémon Mystery Dungeon Red/Blue/Time/Darkness/Sky, Pokémon Colosseum/XD/Battle Revolution, and Pokémon Conquest, respectively. They are responsible for all but two of the bgms used in this game.<br>
<br>
Extra shoutout to Pokémon Conquest: It's awesome. Get it. ^_^<br>
<br>
Finally, I have one last thing to say to this community about this game. <br>
<br>
This is most likely going to be the final script I ever release in Touhou Danmakufu 0.12m. Along with PhantomSong and some other scripters, I am learning ph3, as can be seen by the post for my LOCAA Contest 4 entry. From here on out, I'll be scripting in Touhou Danmakufu ph3. I will try to get more of my Danmakufu Tutorials done so that I can begin work on a ph3 transition guide. Other than that, if there are any glaring bugs that my beta-testers or I did not pick up, please notify me via Skype or via PM so that I can fix it. And yes, I will patch this thing until it works. XD<br>

	      <h2 style="color:yellow;text-shadow:2px 2px orange;font-size:18px;font-weight: normal;">POSTMORTEM</h2>
	      <p>Pok&eacute;DigiDanmaku was my primary project in Danmakufu 0.12m and was an integral part of developing my own coding style and creating my 0.12m system. However, I will let the official post and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.shrinemaiden.org/forum/index.php/topic,13738.msg1057145.html#msg1057145">the release post</a> (archived copy above) do most the talking - they sum up the entire project. The release post contains all of the emotions that accompanied the uneventful release of this game.</p>
	      <p>Overall, making PDD was a really interesting and valuable experience for me. Terrible lack of plot and poor planning aside, it's a pretty solid game. It may not have the fanfare or quality of the work of someone more experienced, but it was what got me on the path of "I can do this and therefore, I will." It's system is simple, its danmaku solid, albeit completely unbalanced, and the item spawn patterns are both confusing and elegant at the same time.</p>
	      <h2 style="color:yellow;text-shadow:2px 2px orange;font-size:18px;font-weight: normal;">LEGAL AND CREDITS</h2>
