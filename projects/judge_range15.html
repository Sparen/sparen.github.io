Difficulty: Default

Midboss Nonspell 1: Overall, although it is exceptionally pretty, it feels completely out of character.
	It's also painfully boring once you realize what the pattern is. [06/10]
Midboss Nonspell 2: Once again, it feels completely out of character, and it can be cheap at times. [06/10]
Midboss Nonspell 3: This attack feels much more like Aya than it does Orin, even if it is nice. [06/10]
Boss Nonspell 1: I cannot express how un-Koishi-like this nonspell is. Also, you've only used two bullet
	colors for the entirety of the script so far. [05/10]
Boss Spell 1: Instict "Mind Stinger": It's very nice to look at but doesn't feel interesting in context.
	Also, the effects Koishi makes when she moves look like bullets. [08/20]
Boss Nonspell 2: Arguably even less Koishi-like than her other nonspell, but I appreciate the change in
	color. The rainbow is nice. [06/10]
Boss Spell 2: Response "Tracing Thought": Finally an in-character attack! And a good one too. I appreciate
	the way you have the tracing, and it's done in a way that is not too challenging yet is pleasing
	to the eye. Nice job here. A little too shiny though. XD [16/20]
Boss Nonspell 3: Border of Wave and Particle? Really? You're more creative than this. [04/10]
Boss Spell 3: Instinct "Freudian Slip": I like this spell and how it's a new spin on something that is
	very Koishi. It's surprisingly hard compared to the rest of the script so far though. [17/20]
Boss Spell 4: "Crayola Garden": This spell is excellently executed and fits Koishi very well. I like how
	it incorporates the roses as well. Can be very hard on the eyes though. [18/20]
Boss Spell 5: "Latent Dream": This spell is sort of Koishi-like but at the same time gets boring quickly.
	I like the variations, but there are better attacks in this script. [16/20]

-No sound effects at all?
-You should tone down the ADD blending, and definitely use different bullet types.</pre>

Difficulty: Default

Lily Nonspell 1: The bullets in this spell look horrible. No offense. Also, the pattern itself is
	disappointing. [06/10]
Lily Spell 1: Flower Sign "Comet Flower": It looks very pretty but does not feel like something that
	Lily White would use. [14/20]
Lily Nonspell 2: Like the first nonspell, nothing particularly notable here. Has the same problems
	as the first nonspell, except even less like Lily White. [05/10]
Lily Spell 2: "Flower-shaped Meteor-Shower": Feels like the nonspells except potentially even worse
	since it's basically static. Graphics are hideous, attack is nonspell tier. [08/20]
Lily Spell 3: "Memories of Sixty Years": It looks pretty and feels in-character-ish. However, I have
	no idea what those white things are doing, and it is very easy to get completely trapped
	within the flowers before they collapse in near the end. [15/20]
Wriggle Nonspell 1: Feels like Wriggle! Except it also feels like Lily's nonspells earlier. You should
	really cut down on those criss-crossing bullets for everything. [08/10]
Wriggle Spell 1: Butterfly Sign "Dance of Butterflies": The angular velocity becomes so painful at the
	end that it almost becomes unfair. Also, feels like Aya more than Wriggle. [13/20]
Wriggle Nonspell 2: Looks nice, different from the rest, good. But needs more... Wriggle. [07/10]
Wriggle Spell 2: Star Sign "Star of Fireflies": Those lasers seem to be transparent down the middle.
	This is confusing, and although the spell is really nice, that really detracts from the spell.
	Also, more color variety would be nice. [16/20]
Shared Spell: "Firefly Path ~ Bright Path", "Spring Lane ~ Colorful Path": Worst of both worlds.
	The bullet graphics are ugh, the colors don't fit, and the pattern is repetitive, monotonous,
	and overused. It's not fun or original or interesting in the slightest. [06/20]

-Please use .ogg
-Please do not use super extended tracks
-Although I like the background, going backwards just feels weird. Also, the texture is not seamless.</pre>
