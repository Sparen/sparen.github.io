My Player: DDC Reimu B

Difficulty: Default

Midboss Nonspell 1: Overall, although it is exceptionally pretty, it feels completely out of character.
	It's also painfully boring once you realize what the pattern is. [06/10]
Midboss Nonspell 2: Once again, it feels completely out of character, and it can be cheap at times. [06/10]
Midboss Nonspell 3: This attack feels much more like Aya than it does Orin, even if it is nice. [06/10]
Boss Nonspell 1: I cannot express how un-Koishi-like this nonspell is. Also, you've only used two bullet
	colors for the entirety of the script so far. [05/10]
Boss Spell 1: Instict "Mind Stinger": It's very nice to look at but doesn't feel interesting in context.
	Also, the effects Koishi makes when she moves look like bullets. [08/20]
Boss Nonspell 2: Arguably even less Koishi-like than her other nonspell, but I appreciate the change in
	color. The rainbow is nice. [06/10]
Boss Spell 2: Response "Tracing Thought": Finally an in-character attack! And a good one too. I appreciate
	the way you have the tracing, and it's done in a way that is not too challenging yet is pleasing
	to the eye. Nice job here. A little too shiny though. XD [16/20]
Boss Nonspell 3: Border of Wave and Particle? Really? You're more creative than this. [04/10]
Boss Spell 3: Instinct "Freudian Slip": I like this spell and how it's a new spin on something that is
	very Koishi. It's surprisingly hard compared to the rest of the script so far though. [17/20]
Boss Spell 4: "Crayola Garden": This spell is excellently executed and fits Koishi very well. I like how
	it incorporates the roses as well. Can be very hard on the eyes though. [18/20]
Boss Spell 5: "Latent Dream": This spell is sort of Koishi-like but at the same time gets boring quickly.
	I like the variations, but there are better attacks in this script. [16/20]
Boss Spell 6: "Dial and Drop": This spell really captures Urban Legend in Limbo but at the same time, is
	very, very long due to the giant lifebar, and the instructions may not be clear at first, especially
	because they're scrolling on the right side of the screen at the same time that they player must 
	dodge. [16/20]

My Player: ILS Reimu B

Difficulty: Contest Easy

Nonspell 1: Standard Youmu but with appropriate color choices. I love the multi-phase approach. It is
	executed quite well as well. [10/10]
Spell 1: Soul Reaping "Soul Crossing in the AfterLife": I like how it really fits Youmu with the style.
	The color choices are appropriate and it is an amazing original spell. That pre-slash effect
	is likewise beautiful and fits the theme excellently. [20/20]
Nonspell 2: I like how the attack is multi-phase and in-theme. However, those yellow walls ruin the
	experience because you can easily get trapped on the wrong side of one of the walls. [07/10]
Spell 2: Hollow Night "Blooming Undead Sakura": I find the use of the bullet choices here appropriate
	and enjoyable. The spell is cohesive and nice to play, but gets boring quickly. [18/20]
Nonspell 3: Another nice nonspell with elements I like and elements that I don't like. This time,
	there are too many parts, and some of them don't really feel like they are needed. [07/10]
Spell 3: Dead Light "Undead Realm Ghost Curse": I like the spell, but Youmu's non-slash attacks...
	just don't appeal to me. It may be the difficulty, or might just be the way one of the
	formations just seems to wall the player. [17/20]

Difficulty: Default

Lily Nonspell 1: The bullets in this spell look horrible. No offense. Also, the pattern itself is
	disappointing. [06/10]
Lily Spell 1: Flower Sign "Comet Flower": It looks very pretty but does not feel like something that
	Lily White would use. [14/20]
Lily Nonspell 2: Like the first nonspell, nothing particularly notable here. Has the same problems
	as the first nonspell, except even less like Lily White. [05/10]
Lily Spell 2: "Flower-shaped Meteor-Shower": Feels like the nonspells except potentially even worse
	since it's basically static. Graphics are hideous, attack is nonspell tier. [08/20]
Lily Spell 3: "Memories of Sixty Years": It looks pretty and feels in-character-ish. However, I have
	no idea what those white things are doing, and it is very easy to get completely trapped
	within the flowers before they collapse in near the end. [15/20]
Wriggle Nonspell 1: Feels like Wriggle! Except it also feels like Lily's nonspells earlier. You should
	really cut down on those criss-crossing bullets for everything. [08/10]
Wriggle Spell 1: Butterfly Sign "Dance of Butterflies": The angular velocity becomes so painful at the
	end that it almost becomes unfair. Also, feels like Aya more than Wriggle. [13/20]
Wriggle Nonspell 2: Looks nice, different from the rest, good. But needs more... Wriggle. [07/10]
Wriggle Spell 2: Star Sign "Star of Fireflies": Those lasers seem to be transparent down the middle.
	This is confusing, and although the spell is really nice, that really detracts from the spell.
	Also, more color variety would be nice. [16/20]
Shared Spell: "Firefly Path ~ Bright Path", "Spring Lane ~ Colorful Path": Worst of both worlds.
	The bullet graphics are ugh, the colors don't fit, and the pattern is repetitive, monotonous,
	and overused. It's not fun or original or interesting in the slightest. [06/20]

Comments
-Please use .ogg
-Please do not use super extended tracks
-Although I like the background, going backwards just feels weird. Also, the texture is not seamless.
-The bullet graphics could really use some work, although it is specifically the ice and large red orb
	bullets that did the most damage to your Theme and Experience score.</pre>

My Player: Reimu Hakurei

Difficulty: Default

Nonspell 1: Standard nonspell, looks nice. Get boring super fast though. More variety, maybe? [07/10]
Spell 1: Border Sign "Boundary of Earth and Sky": This is basically just Sans with lots and lots of
	bullets. It's not particularly bad, but it doesn't strike me as... interesting. [16/20]
Nonspell 2: Standard Yukari with a twist! I like it, but it gets way too dense inside the box. [08/10]
Spell 2: Barrier "Triple Death Butterfly": Less interesting than the original, in my opinion. [14/20]
Nonspell 3: In-character but exceptionally cheap and ow my ears. [04/10]
Spell 3: Old-Aged Past "Seiko Fujita's Throwing Star": I like the pattern here very much. However,
	it immediately dissolves into a wall of bullets that accelerates rather quickly given the
	small space you have to dodge. [15/20]
Spell 4: "Boundary of Gensokyo": Hellishly boring until the bubbles. Nothing special, and not
	original. [10/20]
Spell 5: Perfect Cherry Blossom "Yukari Yakumo's Reawakening": Definitely feels like a Yuyuko spell.
	The danmaku gets quite unfair without delay on those lasers and vertical walls with those
	green butterflies. And it actually doesn't have much variety. [13/20]

Comments
-Please consider using .ogg
-In the future, keep resources you don't use OUTSIDE of your scripts and only use individual files
	when necessary.
-Never remove the FPS meter
-If you are going to do a special mechanic, the game should use that mechanic in a unique way.
	What you have presented here is not Undertale-ish and just frustrates the player at times.
	This is why your Theme and Experience score is so low - if you had made patterns that
	worked well with the small player movement box, then it would have been much higher.</pre>

Nonspell 1: Well then. It's very Koishi. Very appropriate. But it's not clear that you need to
	progress through the dialogue to continue. [08/10]
Spell 1: Sympathy "Heartstring Breaker": An excellent Koishi-like spell that is both fair and
	enjoyable to play. [20/20]
Spell 2: Contradiction "Cognitive Dissonance": Another excellent spell with just the right amount
	of Koishi. However, feels slightly less amazing than Heartstring Breaker. [19/20]
Kagerou: "Obligatory Spell for the Halloween Contest":
	Phase 1: Standard Kagerou here. The knives can be a royal pain though. The first type
		tends to wall, while the second does not feel like either Kagerou or Koishi. [08/10]
	Phase 2: Overall, this phase is well-crafted, but Kagerou's red pellets don't feel like
		they belong. Also, the bullet density can get high in parts of the screen. [08/10]
	Phase 3: At this point it's hilarious but gets painful if you get walled/cornered. [08/10]
Sans: It's like Sans got weaker or something. Not nearly as exciting or surprising as Sans actually 
	was in-game. Sort of a let down. [07/10]
Spell: "You are gonna have a BAD TIME": 
	Phase 1: The individual parts here all work well, and are well-appreciated. [10/10]
	Kanako: "Sacrificial Wind Oracle": Overall, this gets really boring really fast. It resembles 
		the original(s) but... it just doesn't feel amazing or anything. [15/20]
	Phase 2: I appreciate the meme addition but they barely have any effect on gameplay. [09/10]
	Junko: "Pure Nameless Danmaku for Killing People": Standard Junko. Fits well here. [20/20]
	Phase 3: I appreciate the Mitori/Yukari signs. [10/10]
	Byakuren: "Sealed Soul Recitation": Like the original, except with less stuff. Not bad, per
		se, but it feels like a letdown. [16/20]
	Phase 4: I appreciate the brofists and anchors here. :) [10/10]
	Miko: "Light of the True Administrator": An excellent combination of two of Miko's attacks.
		It works excellently but at the same time also proposes a completely different 
		strategy for clearing the attack. Nice job. [20/20]
	Phase 5: My main complaint is that the trains don't always spawn as intended. [09/10]
	Yuyuko: "Ghastly of the Butterfly Effect": Overall, a letdown. You've done far better in other
		phases, but this one feels like meh, mainly because it's just... Yuyuko. Nothing 
		special or original here. [16/20]
	Phase 6: My biggest complaint here is that the YAM does not appear for all people, and the
		danmaku gets particularly crazy by this point. [08/10]
Sans: I love how it's basically Sans, but since most of it feels like/is a direct copy... it doesn't
	feel particularly interesting. [14/20]

Difficulty: Hard

Nonspell 1: Solid Doremy, although an obvious ripoff of her canon attacks. [7/10]
Spell 1: Pinkish Dream "Baku Baku Spin"/Dream Magic "Pink Peaceful YUME[A]": A really nice (although 
	not amazing) spell. It's original and I like that. [15/20]
Nonspell 2: Solid Doremy once more, though OW MY EARS. Also, that ripoff. [5/10]
Spell 2: Bluish Dream "The Lost Souls Wandering in Space"/Dream Magic "Blue Deep YUME[B]": Does not feel 	like Doremy. Also, those stars can really wall you with ease. A lot of sound as well. [15/20]
Nonspell 3: A combination of Doremy's Extra Third Spell, Len'en, and Junko. Not original. [05/10]
Spell 3: Reddish Dream "Projectile Masquerade"/Dream Magic "Red Horrible YUME[C]": An interesting attack 	you have here. However, knives may not be that appropriate for Doremy, and my ears hurt. [16/20]
Nonspell 4: Finally a nonspell that feels original and in-character. Nice job here. [09/10]
Spell 4: Greenish Dream "Foggy Fairy Dance"/Dream Magic "Green Wonderful YUME[D]": I love this spell. If 	only it felt like Doremy and not Yuuka or some plant youkai. [15/20]
Spell 5: Eternal Dream "Eternal Nameless Dream"/"Eternal Nameless YUME[A-E]": 
	Phase 1: Feels like spam, although it's not actually that bad. Even Remilia doesn't spam this
		much. [04/10]
	Phase 2: While it's not terrible, it feels like Yuyuko but worse. If you're going to have
		Doremy use other characters' attacks, make them good please. [03/10]
	Phase 3: It's Kaguya but with enough purple to make my eyes bleed. [02/10]
	Phase 4: Kaguya again, but slightly better. [03/10]
	Phase 5: I like the way you did this attack, but I can't even tell who's being replicated.
		Overall, better than the other phases so far, danmaku-wise. [04/10]
	Phase 6: If Kanako only used one color, it would be like this. Not appreciated. Also, way too
		simple and repetitive. [03/10]
	Phase 7: It's Utsuho without the safespot and with an excessive amount of green ADD-rendering
		covering the entire screen. Please make it fair. [02/10]
	Phase 8: Byakuren, but super boring and super-blue. [03/10]
	Phase 9: Miko! Except that's all! The attack is super repetitive and is basically just Miko.
		[03/10]
	Phase 10: Feels like Sukuna got bored and decided that she would remove portions of one of
		her nonspells. [03/10]
	Phase 11: Junko is not appreciated. [02/10]

NOTE: UPDATED AFTER CONTEST DEADLINE. VERSION 3.drm WILL NOT BE JUDGED.
-I have no idea which version Hecatia (on Youtube) played, but the spell names there were infinitely
	better than what you had in the version I played.
-If you're going to copy other characters's attacks, please give a reason of some sort, and please
	don't change the colors of the bullets to just be one color. It made things worse than they
	already were from both a visual and experience perspective.</pre>

My Player: Nue

Difficulty: Easyish

Nonspell 1: Standard Hecatia. I approve. However, those walls are ehh... [08/10]
Spell 1: Pumpkin Head "Ghosts of Candies Unopened": I really like this spell and how the blue stars
	are used. However, the spell can be unintuitive to beginners. [18/20]
Nonspell 2: More Hecatia. A lot simpler than the first nonspell. [10/10]
Spell 2: Pumpkin Head "Lunar Bones Inevitable Kegare": Confusing, doesn't feel like Hecatia, and
	overall doesn't feel like it belongs here. Having bullet come from the bottom of the screen
	is probably the worst part of the spell. [11/20]
Nonspell 3: Not a bad nonspell, but feels a little too RNG based with the single kunai. [09/10]
Spell 3: Pumpkin Head "The Horrors of Trick or Treating": A likeable spell that can get painful
	because your range just isn't enough. I like how the player is integrated directly into the
	script, utilizing the backwards shots. [19/20]
Spell 4: "Nameless Faceless Trinity": Ripoff of AJS, except that the transition from ADD to ALPHA
	rendering makes bullets near-impossible to see. Execution wise, this really doesn't work, 
	in my opinion. Bullets are generally too fast/hard to see. [10/20]

-Flash bomb system is wonky. :|
-Overall, it was above average in my opinion. I appreciate the player being specially used for
	this script, but... eh.
-I really felt that the script had no replay value, with two of the spells being either unfair
	or rip-offs, and all the nonspells basically looking and being the same.</pre>
