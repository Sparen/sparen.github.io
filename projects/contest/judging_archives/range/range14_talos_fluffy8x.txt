-Danmaku- (15 point)

Closure Sign "Orreries Cross" :
A bit random pattern. Bubbles move very fast
[12/20]

Magic Bullet "Erratic Meteor
Random angles, random speed, random bullets everywhere. Sometimes they spawn outside StgFrame and caught me off guard.
[11/20]

Light Sign "High-Speed Master Spark"
Pretty frustrating . Marisa's movement is so random, and pattern is cheap.
[9/20]

Blazing Star
The first phase of this pattern where you have to dodge lasers from top,bottom,left and right is very boring.
The second phase is much more tolerable, until the last 3 seconds. Every bullet suddenly start moving without any warning. You don't have to ask me how cheap it is.

Overall, for the main boss fight you get 7.875 points out of 15

-Visual & Effect- (3 point)
Visual is ok. Lack of Marisa spell background, though
I didn't notice any effect here. So, I guessed there is none?
[1/3]

-Others (Difficulty,Aesthetics) - (2 point)
Difficulty is poor balanced, they either too easy or too hard. (or cheap)
I quite like stage theme, but the boss theme is questionable. It doesn't seem to fit with the boss fight.
[1/2]

Extra Credit (Stage,Midboss,Player,Gimmick,etc) (1 points).
Stage is quite bad.
I like Yukari midboss spell card, a bit. At least it's something original.
