AJS's Supercool Judging System!

* My focus is on fun factor, fairness, and challenge of the danmaku.  Aesthetics will be a MINOR component to reward going the extra mile or punish bad design choices.
* I will score your entry based on the difficulty that is most "playable" for me (typically somewhere around Normal/Hard) while still being fun and fair
	** I will not factor in how well your difficulty settings are balanced, however.  That'd just kinda complicate things.
	** It would still be to your benefit to make balanced difficulties though--or at least more than one--so I can find a difficulty most suited to me for scoring

My scoring system will be as such:
	>0 -- Unplayable (i.e. broken, extremely buggy, etc.)
	>1 -- Terrible/No effort
	>2 -- Bad
	>3 -- Needs work
	>4 -- Has potential
	>5 -- Average
	>6 -- Okay
	>7 -- Decent
	>8 -- Good
	>9 -- VERY good
	>10 -- One of the best things I've seen

		-Stage portion (if you have one): X/10
		-Each nonspell (midboss included): X/10
		-Each spell card (midboss included): X/10
	*All scores will then be averaged, then multiplied by 2 to give a final score of XX.XX/20.00
	*Aesthetic bonus 
	(May be applied to individual pattern scores for making especially pretty/eye-sore attacks, or to overall score for general script aesthetics):
		*You will receive neither a penalty nor bonus for making a decent to look at script that doesn't stand out.  I don't want to tip things in the favor of advanced scripters too much.
		-Score bonus for going above and beyond to make something beautiful: +4% if applied to individual attack score; +2% if applied to overall script score
		-Score penalty for making poor aesthetic choices that make certain things hard to see or look at: -4% if applied to individual attack score; -2% if applied to overall script score
	
I will also do my best to provide commentary on every aspect of your script throughout my judging, pointing out things you did right and things you could
improve on.  I wouldn't call myself an expert, but these comments will just be my honest opinions and advice on what you could do for future scripts, or if you
wanted to improve your contest entry script after the contest.

***DISCLAIMER: Please don't get hurt if I give your script bad/mediocre scores.  I try to be as strict and objective as possible when scoring, so even scripts that I personally liked or thought
were pretty decent may still get "meh" scores from me.  I try not to sugarcoat things in the hopes that you can improve, and so long as you're willing to listen to advice, I have nothing but
respect for you.  Also, I'm just really really picky...  So please bear with me ^^; **

Difficulty judged: LUNATIC (not that I had a choice D:)

Stage: 7/10
	*While the stage was mostly just streaming, it was fast-paced and challenging enough to be interesting
	*It also feels very satisfying, despite being so short
	
Nonspell 1: 9/10
	*This nonspell can be very challenging the first few times around, but once you get the hang of it, it's quite fun

Spell 1: 8/10
	*A bit repetitive, and also quite difficult, but challenging and fun once you get the hang of it
	*It's relatively short, so it doesn't overstay its welcome and become too stale from the repetition
	
Nonspell 2: 7/10
	*Really short, but decently fun and challenging
	
Spell 2: 4/10
	*The lasers are really difficult to read and avoid, especially since they still have a hitbox when they start moving after staying still for a while, forcing you to make a tight squeeze
	*The bullet walls themselves are quite tight squeezes, which is just extra annoying given the weird lasers you gotta dodge
	*Basically, I feel this spell just focuses too much on intense micrododging
	
Nonspell 3: 6/10
	*A bit intense, especially the last part of each wave, but not too bad once you learn to take advantage of the tiny hitbox you've given the player
	
Spell 3: 7/10
	*Fairly simple, but the pattern is beautiful and the dodging is pretty fun
	
Nonspell 4: 9/10
	*Probably one of my favorite nonspells because of the variety of micro and macrododging in play here

Spell 4: 8/10
	*Can be very tricky if you haven't seen it before, but it can get fairly fun once you know what you're doing
	
Spell 5: 5/10
	*An interesting pattern to dodge, and very fun up until about the halfway mark when it gets a bit too chaotic and difficult to be fun for me anymore
	

Average scores: 70/100 = 70.00% + [2% AESTHETIC BONUS] = 72.00%

FINAL SCORE: 14.40/20

Final Comments:
	-As is usually the case, your danmaku is very solid and your pattern design is simple yet very fun due to the intensity
	-However, it can be very off-putting that the level of difficulty is so high, especially since there are no alternate difficulty settings
