[Darkness1] Yuuka (Default Difficulty)

[Danmaku = 6.10/10]
this is well a special kind of yuuka, especially in danmaku
the danmaku is something I've never seen yuuka use before
Those are definitely some unique patterns you got going on
what I dont like is how the patterns get too hectic though

[Balancing = 1.40/2]
The difficulty is real, those five spells ramp up a lot
sometimes it was cheap but there were some interesting things
that made it difficult, its actually patterned not jusr random

[Aesthetics = 4.30/5]
This is pretty, the bullets, the effect, not much static in the background
So its really good , the only thing that remotely look static is the Normal BG

[Overall Enjoyment = 1.80/3]

[Final Score = 13.6/20]
I enjoyed this alot, This was pure fun, well other than constantly dying
to the patterns but, with just how pretty it looks and how creative you took
on Yuuka's patterns i can forgive it
