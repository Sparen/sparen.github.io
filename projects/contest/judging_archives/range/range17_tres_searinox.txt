Nonspell 1: (4/10)
	The lasers can spawn from weird angles, which is fun, and the aimed laser prevents you from sitting in one place for too long.
	However, ultimately there's nothing too amazing going on. Just lots and lots of bullets coming from the top of the screen.
	Mix it up a little, please. The aimed laser was a step in the right direction, but it just wasn't enough.

Spell 1: (6/10)
	You have a lot of fancy stuff going on visually, but not so much dodging-wise.
	This is more or less a variation of the nonspell. Restricting the player's dodging space and having handful of bullets spawning from the sides helped.
	Again, though, its still not enough.

Spell 2: (3/10)
	And incredibly slow and boring pattern...
	There just isn't anything going on here.

Overall: (13/30 = 43%)
	Generally, if I can beat a pattern by sitting in one spot and tapping left or right (barely moving from that one spot) its probably not going to be too fun.
	Force the player to move around a bit more. And I don't mean make them go to the center of the screen and stay there. I mean make them have to rush to the center, then rush back to the bottom, then rush back to the center....
	Or make them jump really far to the left or right. It doesn't really matter where they go, just don't let them stay in one place for too long.
	This can be achieved by having walls, or a long stream of aimed bullets, just to name some ideas.
