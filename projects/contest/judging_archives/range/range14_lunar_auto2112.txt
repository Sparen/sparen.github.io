[Auto2112] Rumia (Default Difficulty)

[Danmaku = 4.90/10]
I dont know if your trying to make pretty patterns but...
the nons have Poison Nail in them which is for Yoshika and the first rainbow non is very off character
Next is the mist gimmick which is..uninteresting , try including a twist when it comes to things like this
the first spell just had it dim out , yet you can still see the patterns
second spell just tried covering up rand bullets and the first pattern can cause walling
for the last spell, you were going for SCC Mystia , which goes out of character AND causes cheapshot
remember Rumia's ability is darkness not blindness

[Balancing = 0.90/2]
The difficulty is going everywhere, non 1 makes you squeeze through rainbow
spell 1 has macrododging, I was lucky while playing marisa on this one
considering she doesnt have the smaller hitbox reimu has
either way try to make difficulty ramp up if you will even if this is one difficulty

[Aesthetics = 2.6/5]
This is...too simple..theres no spell card bg to spice things up
All im seeing is the scrolling water background from MoF
I wont mind the lack of cutin but here's the thing, rumia doesnt animate
you should never neglect boss animation, rumia looks like a statue

[Overall Enjoyment = 1.20/3]

[Final Score = 9.6/20]
this script is too simple for my taste and the patterns dont fit rumia at all
you could have atleast made it interesting. I reccomend experimenting a bit
with the gimmick you plan to use
