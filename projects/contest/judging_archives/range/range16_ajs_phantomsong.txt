AJS's Supercool Judging System!

* My focus is on fun factor, fairness, and challenge of the danmaku.  Aesthetics will be a MINOR component to reward going the extra mile or punish bad design choices.
* I will score your entry based on the difficulty that is most "playable" for me (typically somewhere around Normal/Hard) while still being fun and fair
	** I will not factor in how well your difficulty settings are balanced, however.  That'd just kinda complicate things.
	** It would still be to your benefit to make balanced difficulties though--or at least more than one--so I can find a difficulty most suited to me for scoring

My scoring system will be as such:
	>0 -- Unplayable (i.e. broken, extremely buggy, etc.)
	>1 -- Terrible/No effort
	>2 -- Bad
	>3 -- Needs work
	>4 -- Has potential
	>5 -- Average
	>6 -- Okay
	>7 -- Decent
	>8 -- Good
	>9 -- VERY good
	>10 -- One of the best things I've seen

		-Stage portion (if you have one): X/10
		-Each nonspell (midboss included): X/10
		-Each spell card (midboss included): X/10
	*All scores will then be averaged, then multiplied by 2 to give a final score of XX.XX/20.00
	*Aesthetic bonus 
	(May be applied to individual pattern scores for making especially pretty/eye-sore attacks, or to overall score for general script aesthetics):
		*You will receive neither a penalty nor bonus for making a decent to look at script that doesn't stand out.  I don't want to tip things in the favor of advanced scripters too much.
		-Score bonus for going above and beyond to make something beautiful: +4% if applied to individual attack score; +2% if applied to overall script score
		-Score penalty for making poor aesthetic choices that make certain things hard to see or look at: -4% if applied to individual attack score; -2% if applied to overall script score
	
I will also do my best to provide commentary on every aspect of your script throughout my judging, pointing out things you did right and things you could
improve on.  I wouldn't call myself an expert, but these comments will just be my honest opinions and advice on what you could do for future scripts, or if you
wanted to improve your contest entry script after the contest.

***DISCLAIMER: Please don't get hurt if I give your script bad/mediocre scores.  I try to be as strict and objective as possible when scoring, so even scripts that I personally liked or thought
were pretty decent may still get "meh" scores from me.  I try not to sugarcoat things in the hopes that you can improve, and so long as you're willing to listen to advice, I have nothing but
respect for you.  Also, I'm just really really picky...  So please bear with me ^^; **

Difficulty judged: N/A

Nonspell 1: 5/10
	*Fairly rudimentary pattern, is very easy to dodge for the most part
	*I would be careful with how much you let RNG decide the angles of those triangle shots, because I've gotten walled a couple times
	
Spell 1 (Bullet Sign "Shifting Shot"): 6/10
	*Pretty pattern, and fairly interesting to dodge
	*It would've been nice if there were a bit more variety though
	
Nonspell 2: 6/10
	*Also a simple pattern, but the faster triangles make dodging more interesting
	*I haven't encountered too many issues with the RNG here.  Still, for the future I would recommend making some patterns with semi-randomness, rather than basically giving a direction and saying "fire somewhere in that general area"
	
Spell 2 (Bullet Sign "Skip Shot"): 4/10
	*Not a bad concept, but the lack of pattern variety and Seiran staying still make the pattern very repetitive and stale
	*I can pretty much just park myself in a spot at the bottom of the screen and only move a little when a bullet is about to directly hit me
	
Nonspell 3: 4/10
	*Even though it's just a simple streaming pattern, the triangles make the dodging a bit more interesting
	*If you had supplemented the triangles with another pattern, or perhaps changed things up a bit, this could be very fun
	
Spell 3 (Lunar Ops "Hallucinogenic Poison Bullet"): 5/10
	*Not a bad concept, though I wish you had done more with it.  With only a simple bullet pattern, dodging this attack gets repetitive fairly fast
	
Nonspell 4: 5/10
	*Not bad, but I feel it could've been better if the dark blue bullets were a bit denser, perhaps even faster?  And perhaps widen up the gaps in the aqua bullets to compensate. 
	*Because as-is, you're pretty much just sitting in the lanes and dodging a few dark blue bullets that occasionally head your way
	
Spell 4 (Lunar Ops "Lunarian Defense Unit"): 6/10
	*Decently fun to dodge, but again, rather repetitive as dodging is just reduced to sidestepping the triangles and avoiding the rest of the fairly simple danmaku
	
Spell 5 ("Warfare from the Alternate Dimension"): 7/10
	*Despite being a streaming spell, having to avoid and plan for the large triangles is quite fun while having to manage streaming the lasers
	

Average Score: 48/90 = 53.33%

FINAL SCORE: 10.67/20

Final Comments:
	-Your patterns were pretty solid, but the level of difficulty felt very underwhelming.  
	-For future reference, I would recommend making alternate difficulties so that higher-level players don't get bored
