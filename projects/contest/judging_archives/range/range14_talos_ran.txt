-Danmaku- (15 point)

Non-Spell 1 :
It's a bit boring. All I need to do is move left-right-left-right and nothing else.
[9/15]

Destruction "Massive Fireball"
I love the effect you used here, but I think the screen shake effect need to be toned down a bit, combining with the explosion bullets (which are really tense), this spell card is nearly impossible to capture.
[13/20]

Non-Spell 2 :
This is a bit more fun than non-spell 1. Bubbles are always pleasure to dodge.
[11.5/15]

Nuclear Power "Fusion Reaction"
The nuclears are quite hard to see,especially when they're stacked together.
[14/20]

Nonspell 3 :
A solid non-spell.Not much to say here.
[12/15]

Nuclear Power "Fission Reaction"
Wow, I kinda like the concept behind this. Danmaku is good,too.
[16/20]

Reaction "Neutron Ejection"
IT'S THREEDEEEEEEEE.
As much as I love 3D spell card, this one exceeded my expectation. My only complaints is that it's a bit too easy.
[17/20]

Link Spell "Hydrogen-3"
Link Spell "Uranium-235"
Link Spell "Plutonium-239"
3 Utsuho? What sorcery is this? :V
Speaking of danmaku, while myself can guess the meaning behind the spell card, I think it's still a bit too bland for her character. Utsuho deserve more climactic pattern (and this is final spell, should be the most climactic pattern).
Anyway, the pattern itself is ok. Not much noticeable,though.
[14.5/20]

Overall, for the main boss fight you get 11.07 points out of 15

-Visual & Effect- (3 point)
Visual is pretty nice, no complaint.
I really love the effects you used, especially Utsuho's charge effect.
[2.5/3]

-Others (Difficulty,Aesthetics) - (2 point)
Difficulty is imbalanced in someplace, but still good.
[1/2]

Extra Credit (Stage,Midboss,Player,Gimmick,etc) (1 points).
I like the koishi player. Wish she had a bomb,though.
