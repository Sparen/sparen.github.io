Even though there's no stage, the dialogue is more than enough compensation by giving a summary of the idea behind this contest. I have a feeling that in this script, it's not just the abilities of the characters that are inverted, but even their personalities are more or less reversed as well. I wonder why~

On the whole, the danmaku is very faithful to the original characters. I do like how Kyouko's gimmick is changed from bouncing bullets to redirecting them. Kyouko and Mystia work very well together, too. The difficulty also stays generally consistent, rising slightly near the end but still manageable.

As a side note, the last spell appears to prematurely restore Kyouko's true ability - the burst of fast random orbs seems to be much like the release of concentrated sound. This, for me, went against what the contest was about.

Still, this is a very well made entry. You never disappoint.
