-Danmaku- (15 point)

Non-spell 1 :
Simple, yet effective nonspell. I don't have any complaint except Yukari's movement is a bit too frequent, making it hard to hit her with non-homing player. [12.5/15]

Inversion "Reality and Fantasy" :
Interesting concept.It suits Yukari's power very well.
If only Yukari shoot less butterfly bullets, I would enjoy this a bit more. [15/20]

Non-spell 2 :
Again, Yukari moves too much. Sometimes she's on the edge of the screen. Pretty frustrating for non-homing player [11.5/15]

Boundary Sign "Border of Zone and Apathy" :
This is a very luck-based spell card. Yukari movement is completely random. For the first phase she can wall you easily by her pellets and large bullets.
The second phase where she fire volley of bullets to you is ok. Still, I don't understand the purpose of this spell card. [13/20]

Non-spell 3 :
I have seen a pattern like this before, in a well-known script, but I will pretend I didn't see it.
And yeah...I like it. [13/15]

Yakumo Spirit "Her Playful Psyche"
Yeah, it's a good pattern.Although I dislike the lasers. You could have done better without have to randomly fire them.
And if use a player with homing shot, you can pretty much stand still at the left/right side of screen and dodge only butterfly/dot bullets, since there isn't any laser there.[16/20]

Overall, for the main boss fight you get 11.57 points out of 15

-Visual & Effect- (3 point)
Visual look fine.
The charge effect is pretty. I quite like it.
[2.25/3]

-Others (Difficulty,Aesthetics) - (2 point)
Difficulty seem to be around hard. It's very well balanced (except spell 1)
The boss fight is very flow. I enjoy it until the end
[1.75/2]

Extra Credit (Stage,Midboss,Player,Gimmick,etc) (1 points).
Don't seem to have any.
