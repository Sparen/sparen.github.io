Danmaku Quality: 7.8/8 Good quality bullets! Nothing unfair going on here. I'm a little concerned about the bullet trails changing angles in Daiyousei's first non-spell by herself. Some of them change direction way late. The difficulties are balanced properly from what I can tell.

Contest Theme: 6/8 The characters barely have any original danmaku to begin with, so I can't really compare what they had before in terms of attack style, other than bullets they used. 
But I think you did pretty good with what you chose. 

Music, Graphics, Appeal: 3.8/4 You put a lot into making this look and sound nice! Very well put together.
