RaNGE 21 - Lusus
 
For this contest I'll continue using a 20-point rating system. Points will be divided as follows:
 
Danmaku Quality: 12/20
 
Danmaku Quality encompasses the quality of the danmaku in your script. "Good" patterns will equal a "good" score in this category. What makes a pattern good is subjective, but the #1 factor is fun. A flashy, gorgeous pattern that isn't fun won't fare well here. Note that aesthetic factors can still factor into this - proper usage of sound effects and graphics can make an unfair pattern fair, and improper usage of those can make an otherwise-fair pattern unfair.
 
Individual patterns will be rated out of 10. The average of that will be taken and scaled to calculate the Danmaku Quality score.
 
Aesthetics: 4/20
 
This category encompasses how your entry looks (and sounds). While danmaku should absolutely come first, visual and audio elements are also a part of the gameplay experience.
 
Adherence to the Shape Theme: 4/20
 
4 points will be dedicated to how your script uses shapes. Shoving shapes everywhere will not result in a good score, though - I'll also consider if it seems to fit the character. Mostly subjective but I'll give reasoning for why.

+1 Happy Tricky points for using the updated version of Ultima Reimu.

Nonspell 1: A little messy visually, but it's a fun pattern! Feels appropriate for Nue while following the theme and being a reasonable challenge. Maybe a little too hard? 7.75/10.

Spell 1: Fits the character and is a neat challenge. Could maybe use a little bit more of a pattern but it's fine as-is. 8/10.
 
Nonspell 2: Very solid. Because they're shapes. Ha. Not much else to say, good job. 8/10.

Spell 2: This one drags on for a while but I do like it otherwise. 7.5/10.
 
Spell 3: I think it was a very good design design to turn off the aimed bullets for the phase when the people danmaku shows up, then turn them back on later. Good! 8/10.

As a minor gripe, be sure you have the Log Window closed when you distribute a script. Having that thing open killed performance. Performance still seems a little choppy without it, but it's an easy win to just have it off for people that wouldn't know to close it.
 
Danmaku Score: 7.85/10 (scaled to 9.42/12)
======================================================================================================================
 
Aesthetically I don't think this script is all that cohesive, but it's not any worse than the Danmakufu defaults. 2/4.
======================================================================================================================
 
You use shapes well without it feeling shoehorned in, and their usage fits the character nicely! It's not super-creative in my opinion, but it's still very good. 3.5/4
 
OVERALL SCORE 9.42 + 2 + 3.5 = 14.92/20
