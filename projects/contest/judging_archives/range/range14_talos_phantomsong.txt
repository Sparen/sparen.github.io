-Danmaku- (15 point)

Non-spell 1 :
A traditional non-spell card. It's done right, but I can't help but think it's still boring.
[10/15]

Wind God "Shinatobe's Elegant Waltz"
The aimed bullets caught me off guard for the first time,but overall it's not that bad. In contrast, it's a good pattern once you know how to deal with it.
[15/20]

Non-spell 2 :
Now this is something interesting. I've seen a pattern like this before, but this one also did its justice.
[13/15]

Storm Sign "Fujin's Cyclone"
Wow, I must say I really like this. If you had done a bit of modification , I would have though zun made this.
[18/20]

Non-spell 3 :
The pattern is ok here. Aimed bullets do a good job
[12/15]

Heaven Sign "Messenger of the Gods"
Ah, I love when I graze those red bullets. They gave me a good feel. I also kinda like the part where she ran left-right to the screen. The butterfly spamming is not bad,too
[16.5/20]

"Tengu's Catastrophic Storm"
At first I though this was a Meiling's pattern. x_x But it's ok, maybe I played EoSD too much.
Anyway, a solid spell card, nothing particular to say here.
[16/20]

Overall, for the main boss fight you get 12.06 points out of 15

-Visual & Effect- (3 point)
Visual is in a standard. (compare to others participants)
Effect is not much, although not bad either.
[1.75/3]

-Others (Difficulty,Aesthetics) - (2 point)
This script is very well-balanced, and very Aya-ish. Music is very fitting. I cannot give any better score here
[2/2]

Extra Credit (Stage,Midboss,Player,Gimmick,etc) (1 points).
Don't seem to have any.
