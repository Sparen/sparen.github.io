RaNGE 20 - Conarnar
 
For this contest I'll continue using a 20-point rating system. Points will be divided as follows:
 
Danmaku Quality: 12/20
 
Danmaku Quality encompasses the quality of the danmaku in your script. "Good" patterns will equal a "good" score in this category. What makes a pattern good is subjective, but the #1 factor is fun. A flashy, gorgeous pattern that isn't fun won't fare well here. Note that aesthetic factors can still factor into this - proper usage of sound effects and graphics can make an unfair pattern fair, and improper usage of those can make an otherwise-fair pattern unfair.
 
Individual patterns will be rated out of 10. The average of that will be taken and scaled to calculate the Danmaku Quality score.
 
Aesthetics: 4/20
 
This category encompasses how your entry looks (and sounds). While danmaku should absolutely come first, visual and audio elements are also a part of the gameplay experience.
 
Adherence to the Seasonal Theme: 4/20
 
4 points will be dedicated to how seasonal your script feels. Things like color choices, pattern design and aesthetic factors all contribute to how "seasonal" a script feels.

Played with YukariB.

Nonspell 1: Youmu nonspell, woo. Doesn't feel very seasonal but it's a decent pattern all the same. 7.75/10.
 
Spell 1: Be careful with randomness because for me it was like every other wave threw nonsense at you. Otherwise a fine concept. 5/10.
 
Nonspell 2: Interesting pattern. Feels like the lingering bullets could be a tad slower. 7.5/10.
 
Spell 2: Fun and fair. Good! 8.5/10.
 
Nonspell 3: I like this one too. Challenging but fair and actually seems seasonally appropriate. 8.25/10.
 
Spell 3: Difficulty seems pretty easy compared to earlier patterns...unless you get unlucky(?), then it's about as hard as the rest. Would be good if it were more consistent. 6.5/10.
 
Nonspell 4: Maybe the tiniest bit generic, but I like the pattern enough to not really care. 7.75/10.
 
Spell 4: Pretty good pattern too. Decent enough way to end the script. 7.5/10.
 
Danmaku Score: 7.34/10 (scaled to 8.81/12)
======================================================================================================================
 
Aesthetically pretty good. The spell background shattering is pretty neat and sounds/visuals are used appropriately. Nothing really amazingly stands out however. 3/4.
======================================================================================================================
 
This script does a pretty good job of fitting the theme at times. The nonspells can be pretty weak about this and some of the spells aren't very strongly-themed. 3.25/4
 
OVERALL SCORE 8.81 + 3 + 3.25 = 15.06/20
