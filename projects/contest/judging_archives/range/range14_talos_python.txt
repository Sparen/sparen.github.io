-Danmaku- (15 point)

Note : Some patterns are slightly different between normal and hard mode,but I only judged hard mode.

Non-spell 1 :
Good modification from the original.
[12/15]

Blaze "Phoenix's Molt"
Pretty nice pattern here, those shiny red things are pretty. 
[17/20]

Non-spell 2 :
A bit easy, but still fun.
[12.5/15]

Flame Sign "Phoenix's Curse"
I've fun moving around the screen,dodging all of bullets that spawn near me.
Yay, you executed this pattern very nicely.
[18.5/20]

Non-spell 3 :
A decent non-spell. Look like the original with circle bullets throw in. It works,though.
[12/15]

Hourai "Reawakening Mt. Fuji"
Wow, this one is great.The pattern,the effects, are done nicely.
The screen-shake effect is good ,too.
[18/20]

Non-spell 4 :
Nice work on multiple phases. They're flow well together.
[14/15]

Fire Bird "The Twin Phoenixes"
There is a difficulty spike in this one when Mokou shoot a blue phoenixe to you at the start of next wave, because there're still many bullets on screen, making it quite troublesome to misdirect.
Nevertheless, this pattern is really well done.
[17.5/20]

Immortality "Countless Deaths"
The patterns are nice and fun to dodge.
Killing Mokou again and again is very satisfying.
[18/20]

Overall, for the main boss fight you get 13.08 points out of 15

-Visual & Effect- (3 point)
Nice work on stage background, spell card background and StgFrame.
Effects are quite pretty,too.
[2.5/3]

-Others (Difficulty,Aesthetics) - (2 point)
Difficulty is either too easy or too hard in some patterns, but it isn't that noticeable.
Mokou's theme is ok, even I don't like this kind of music
[1.25/2]

Extra Credit (Stage,Midboss,Player,Gimmick,etc) (1 points).
A simple but effective midboss.
Both of player are good. I like them
Dialoguee are funny. xD
