Crested judging for RaNGE 20: Unseasonal Mooning Daydream by NecroHeart/Vigor.
Script contains 4 nonspells and 5 spells.
No difficulty selection. Only usable player script is a custom Aya.

I will be judging based on danmaku design, with a high focus on balance and creativity second.
The aesthetics are fantastic and aren't distracting, so no penalty will be issued.

Nonspell 1: Fantastic flower blooming and just the right amount of difficulty with the orbs from the side.
19/20

Summer Fire "Blazing Earth Spirits": An interesting spell that is unfortunately too dense and too difficult compared to the others.
13/20

Nonspell 2: The mini-Suika's suicide bullets adds some complexity to this nonspell.
16/20

Autumn Crowd "Procession of Hundred Demons": Unfocused dodging clears the mini-Suikas so fast that the spell never gets threatening...
15/20

Nonspell 3: Very fun to dodge especially once the large bubbles start spawning.
19/20

Winter Sigh "Strange Labyrinth of Inhalation": Neat timeout spell with gravity. Well-constructed to require macrododging but never walls.
20/20

Nonspell 4: Fast dodging slows down into dense slow waves. The smooth transition between the two makes this quite an interesting pattern.
18/20

Spring Arcanum "Devastation in Three Steps": An interesting take on Knock Out in Three Steps, and significantly more challenging than it.
That said, I think some of the bullet hitboxes are a little too large for such micrododging.
15/20

Overall: 16.9/20
An incredible script that shows what "quality over quantity" means.
