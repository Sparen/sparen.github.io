RaNGE 15 Judgment: Tyrz's Lollipop Stealer
 
All judgments by me will follow the following rubric:
Danmaku Quality*: 12/20
Character Relevance, Creativity, Originality: 4/20
Aesthetics: 4/20
 
*Is it fun to play? Cheap shots, boring sections, all things danmaku. Individual patterns will be graded out of 12 points, and then will be averaged.
 
Anyway, let's get started.
 
Nonspell 1: Rather plain but fun enough to dodge. Nondescript. 7.25/12.
 
Spell 1: Bouncing pumpkins of doom. The pumpkins creating bullets when they bounce is pretty cool, and means the player has to dodge a few bullets from nontypical angles. Pretty good. 8/12.
 
Nonspell 2: Also rather plain but adds some falling Starbow Break-esque bullets. I actually like this a bit less than the previous nonspell. Kinda annoying due to how dense it is + Flanderp moving all over the place. 6.75/12.
 
Spell 2: Quite the odd card. The aimed bullet...line...things? keep the player moving, which is good. The pumpkin explosions are devastating to anyone near them when they explode, but it can be hard at times to get away from them. I think the explosions themselves are kinda plain, as well. Why not have them explode into a star formation or something that's not just a spiral? It's also hard to shoot her with all the movement demanded. 6.5/12.
 
Spell 3: Much cheeto such snake etc. I think it's acceptable. Seems very tense for some reason but the cheeto lasers aren't THAT persistent. It is annoying to shoot her with how much she moves, though. 6/12.

Nonspell 3: Interesting. Reimu's lollipops have bullet erasure powers? Intriguing. The pattern itself is pretty run-of-the-mill, and the bullet deletion lollies of doom are an interesting touch. Pretty neat. 7/12.
 
Spell 4: Four is certainly not kind. Name aside, this spell is fine enough. The clones can't be shot down and have their own patterns which is typical of a card like this. Otherwise it's kinda plain and lengthy. 6/12.
 
Spell 5: Survival card that's Cranberry Trap with many, many twists. Feels pretty messy and getting cornered by purple-shooting flames of doom is unpleasant. It's also rather long. Despite being a survival and the last card I really don't have a lot to say about this. 5.75/12.
 
Danmaku Total: (7.25+8+6.75+6.5+6+7+6+5.75)/8 = 6.66/12
 
As for creativity, you did pretty well. Nonspells are kinda boring but spells are interestingly pumpkin and lollipop based.
...Lollipops.
 
Creativity: 3/4.
 
Aesthetics-wise, you did pretty well. The title screen is cute and the game itself feels kinda retro, what with the music and kinda-PC98 style. Neat. 
 
Aesthetics: 3/4.
 
Total Score: 6.66+3+3 = 12.66
