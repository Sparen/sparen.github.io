Crested judging for RaNGE 20: The Four-Season Magic Study by Asthmagician.
Script contains 4 nonspells and 5 spells.
No difficulty selection. Only player is a custom Remilia player.

I will be judging based on danmaku design, with a high focus on balance and creativity second.
The spell background is really quite distracting. I'll have to deduct 0.5 points from the overall score.

Nonspell 1: Not really difficult and a little barren.
13/20

Summer Flame Sign (Red Moisture Wiper): The flames move in a pretty interesting way but the actual pattern is just lanes...
14/20

Nonspell 2: The slightly overlap between the bubbles and pellets make for a slightly interesting pattern.
15/20

Autumn Edge Sign (Harvest of Edges): I mean... it's just obvious streaming with giant time gaps to restream. Would be more interesting if it was continuously fired.
7/20

Nonspell 3: Now this is a good nonspell.
16/20

Winter Water Sign (Sticky Bubble Spout): It's okay to use big bubbles here, you know. As is it's too sparse to pose any real threat.
12/20

Nonspell 4: The arrowheads leaving behind a slow field during the bubbles makes this the best non of the lot.
18/20

Spring Petal Sign (Cherry-Coloured Static Wind): Movement restriction and angled bullets is a good combination.
17/20

Secret Season Sign (Rear-Facing Doyou Crystal): Good multiphase spell, though the first two phases are really quite boring.
17/20

Overall: 14.3/20
A decent script that's kind of easy overall, but that's fine. Some creative ideas within, and with a little tweaking the rest can be quite good as well.
