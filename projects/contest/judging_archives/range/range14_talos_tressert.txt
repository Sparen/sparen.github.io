-Danmaku- (15 point)

It's nice to see you included Tewi as a midboss here. Her opening non-spell is good, but the bouncing red things caught me off guard for the first time. I don't think they're supposed to bounce at the bottom of screen, as I saw them bounce at the left/right side of screen already.
Tewi spell is quite good. I've a lot of fun dodging semi-wallmaku coming from above and below.

And now, our main boss is here, Reisen

Non-spell 1 :
Open with a simple pattern, then it gradually speed up, which is a nice touch. Aim bullets here work well [13/15]

Red Eyes "Eyesight Clearing (Lunatic Stare)" :
The way the patterns are introduced is very good. I can capture it in the first run. The concept is nice,too. [18/20]

Non-spell 2 :
This remind me of Lunatic Gaze "Illusion Seeker" from IN. It's fun and a bit challenging,though. [13.5/15]

Illusion Sign "Violet Eye (Shadow Cloning)" :
Again, you executed Reisen's gimmick very well.
At first, I have some trouble with illusion Reisen's movement (there's no charge effect to tell whether she will move), but I get used to it after a while [17/20]

Non-spell 3 :
I found this is somewhat an easy pattern when you constantly move left to right and vice versa, so Reisen's familiars won't have a chance to fire white bullets, leaving only purple bullets on a screen. It's pretty neat concept,though. I like it [13/15]

Rabbit Sign "Mind Break (Inaba Shooter)"
Another great concept, now with a bit poor in execution.
There is a problem with red-eyes gimmick here. When Reisen active it to turn off bullets' hitbox, it doesn't affect red bullets or blue bullets (I know this might be intention, but it's quite confusing)
And maybe it's just me, but an easy version of this card seem to harder than normal version. [16/20]

"Red Moon Delusion (Hyper Red Moon)"
I don't know how to describe this. The gimmick is very fresh, and danmaku suit it very well. My only complaint is that it's tad long. [19/20]

Overall, for the main boss fight you get 13.14 points out of 15

-Visual & Effect- (3 point)
Visual look good as it should be.
There's not much effect here. Anyway,it looks fine already.
[2.5/3]

-Others (Difficulty,Aesthetics) - (2 point)
Difficulty seem to be harder than it stated (didn't try overdrive difficulty,though, because you said you didn't test it)
Great choice for music, and it sync with battle very well.
[1.5/2]

Extra Credit (Stage,Midboss,Player,Gimmick,etc) (1 points).
Tewi midboss is neat, as I mentioned above
Koishi player is very well done.
[0.75/1]

##### Final Score = 13.44+2.5+1.5+0.75 = 17.89 #####

PS :
I must say I really love your package. Everything seem to work fine, with a nice scrolling background and pretty music. I love how you let me adjust BGM/SE volume, as well as other minor things (I usually find BGM/SE too loud or too low in some scripts, so I have to manually fix it,which is annoying.)
