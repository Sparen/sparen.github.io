[Python] Mokou (Hard Mode)

[Danmaku = 6.50/10]
You did a good job capturing mokou's amulet nonspells
although it looks dense een for hard mode, but considering
mokou never appeared outside of Extra, ok I can overlook it
the Spells are really nice but some have randomness factor in them
like the pheonix spell and Doremy Spell? seriously?
The spell had one too many phases in it but Oh well theres atleast different patterns

[Balancing = 1.40/2]
Hmmm, the difficulty your right on the dime when it comes to hard
but its just a bit crossing the border between lunatic, while some spells
take a step back, like Reawaking of Mt.Fuji, if done right is seriously easy

[Aesthetics = 3.60/5]
Nothing bad, its quite pretty, I love the Ressurection effect though
No errors anywhere, no static Background, its all good but
the very fast BG of the boss is a little distracting so try not to go
too fast when it comes to BG like these

[Overall Enjoyment = 2.10/3]

[Final Score = 13.6/20]
I had a lot of fun with this, the music is loud though but
the patterns are enjoyable and pretty good albeit a bit dense
but you did capture Mokou really well in your patterns
