-Danmaku- (15 point)

Non-spell 1 :
Generic non-spell.Nuff said  [12/15]

Great Flare : -Let This World Burn To Nothing-
What an arousing name.
Blue fires are random, and the burst is very intimidated on the first try. [13/20]

Non-spell 2 :
Another generic non-spell. I think it's much better to create your own pattern, while still make it feel true to character rather than follow Zun's pattern every step. [11.5/15]

Pheonix's Immortality : -The Firey Curse-
Nice pattern here, but it suffered from unoriginality. [10.5/20]

Magestic Wings : -Immortal Feather-
Now this is something original. The aimed Pheonix did a good job. However, it's too easy compare to the entire fight.
[14/20]

Overall, for the main boss fight you get 10.17 points out of 15

-Visual & Effect- (3 point)
At least you managed to animated Mokou's sprite & wings.
Charge effect could be better,though.
[1/3]

-Others (Difficulty,Aesthetics) - (2 point)
Difficulty is more like an easy version of extra mode. (except spell 3 which is too easy.)
The lack of sound effect & music hurt aesthetics a lot.
[0.25/2]

Extra Credit (Stage,Midboss,Player,Gimmick,etc) (1 points).
This is supposed to be a bonus score, so I won't minus your point because your engine has a ton of bugs/glitchs
At least you made a player and it's somewhat...decent.
[0.2/1]
