-Danmaku- (15 point)

Non-spell 1 :
It's a good nonspell, if only purple waves don't kill me a lot.
[10/15]

Magic Sign "Nightmaric Growth"
A tricky spell card here. It caught me off guard on the first try (when those purple things started to spawn at the bottom). Well, it's not like it's a bad spell card.
Once I learnt how to dodge this. It becomes very fun.
[16.5/20]

Non-spell 2 :
This one is solid. I like it.
[13/15]

Love Sign "Sunflower Spark"
Hmm, I have seen this before, but I will pretend I didn't.
Nice pattern here, the execution is great. One complaint is that the lasers' are too large than I though (well, the delays are very thin, so I didn't expect the actual lasers will be THAT wide.)
[17/20]

Non-spell 3 :
Nice effect here, and danmaku is good,too.
[13.5/15]

Symbol "Withering Away in Emptiness"
I don't know how to describe this, I can only say that this is how you make a fair & fun spell card.
[19/20]

Non-spell 4 :
The color is a bit off here, and pattern doesn't seem to fit Yuuka well.
[11/15]

Phantasm "Flower of Forgetfulness"
At first I though that standing in white circle will also remove bullets hitbos.
Well, I was dumb there, but I began to understand the gimmick after my second death.
Yay, the gimmick is very fresh, and danmaku seem to fit with it well. Nice work.
[18/20]

Dream Sign "Purity Seed"
The pattern isn't that intuitive on the first try, but I'm getting good at it.
I think it would be more fun, if I didn't easily get cornered by a flower that keep following me.
[17/20]

Overall, for the main boss fight you get 12.66 points out of 15

-Visual & Effect- (3 point)
The stage background , spell background, as well as StgFrame, are decent.
Effects are very appealing.Nice job here.
[2.25/3]

-Others (Difficulty,Aesthetics) - (2 point)
I can't say that difficulty is balanced enough, there are quite a few spell cards there...which are first-run killer.
Music is good. Not much to say.
[1.25/2]

Extra Credit (Stage,Midboss,Player,Gimmick,etc) (1 points).
Don't seem to have any.
