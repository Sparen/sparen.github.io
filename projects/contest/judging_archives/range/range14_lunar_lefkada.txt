[Lefkada] Koishi (Hard-Uncensored Mode)

[Danmaku = 6.3/10]
Ayy, I'll give you credit for making the patterns interesting
But the thing is after the first non and spell It just died down from being Koishi-like
The Urban Legend Survival IS interesting but the patterns we're hard for wrong reasons
It's just rings that go random speed or something with Koishi constantly hot on your trail
But the thing is Koishi can kill you just by spawning over you making it Unfair
Your rendition of Subterranean Rose is quite good, but then again,minus the last Q.E.D. phase
It's still just rings which can makes it stale after a bit

[Balancing = 0.70/2]
This is too hard even for your hard mode, some are bloody asking me to blindly macrododge
While some encourages me to stream, I know it's koishi but try for a ramping up difficulty than
Making it hard at the start and gets even harder at the end

[Aesthetics = 4/5]
Cool graphics, This version of the rose graphics looks stunning the cut-in feels too slow
Making it seems like it lags though

[Overall Enjoyment = 1.5/3]

[Final Score = 12.5/20]
This was a good script but the danmaku just made it less enjoyable, limited lives and
Unbearable difficulty made it unforgiving , and Bombing....well ok but a bit slow
And forces me to look at the photograph while hell insued, either way great job
But try to make your patterns actually fit for the character
