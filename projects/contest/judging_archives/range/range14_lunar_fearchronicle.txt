[Fear Chronicle] Renko (Default Difficulty)

[Danmaku = 8.6/10]
A Renko script with a stage is quite difficult to judge but either way
This is beautiful, the stage patterns are good but I'm not gonna include that to the scores
As much as I know this is the first time Renko's danmaku has been seen
But from what I see you make great use of Laser and the Stars
The spells are very pretty but the last spell is very unique but uninteresting
It was basically the other patterns of characters simplified and combined

[Balancing = 1.6/2]
This has a fair ramp up, even with the stage,while both Boss and Midboss has the chance to
surprise the players and possible cheapshots can happen there weren't times where it
Was too fast , too slow or too reduntant

[Aesthetics = 5/5]
Full 5 points on graphics!, All the graphics are beautiful and High Definition, i love how everything flows here
Even the dialogue has animation and the bullets are as far as i know self drawn even for the last spell
The graphics just made an already interesting script became even more beautiful

[Overall Enjoyment = 2.4/3]

[Final Score = 17.6/20]
This script is wonderfully crafted, there's not much more to talk about other than
Lag spikes with the HD system but,Because it just Is a great script that wouldn't matter
Good Job Fear Chronicle! Kirbio and Miransu!
