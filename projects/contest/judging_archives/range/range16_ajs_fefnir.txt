Minoriko - by Fefnir

AJS's Supercool Judging System!

* My focus is on fun factor, fairness, and challenge of the danmaku.  Aesthetics will be a MINOR component to reward going the extra mile or punish bad design choices.
* I will score your entry based on the difficulty that is most "playable" for me (typically somewhere around Normal/Hard) while still being fun and fair
	** I will not factor in how well your difficulty settings are balanced, however.  That'd just kinda complicate things.
	** It would still be to your benefit to make balanced difficulties though--or at least more than one--so I can find a difficulty most suited to me for scoring

My scoring system will be as such:
	>0 -- Unplayable (i.e. broken, extremely buggy, etc.)
	>1 -- Terrible/No effort
	>2 -- Bad
	>3 -- Needs work
	>4 -- Has potential
	>5 -- Average
	>6 -- Okay
	>7 -- Decent
	>8 -- Good
	>9 -- VERY good
	>10 -- One of the best things I've seen

		-Stage portion (if you have one): X/10
		-Each nonspell (midboss included): X/10
		-Each spell card (midboss included): X/10
	*All scores will then be averaged, then multiplied by 2 to give a final score of XX.XX/20.00
	*Aesthetic bonus 
	(May be applied to individual pattern scores for making especially pretty/eye-sore attacks, or to overall score for general script aesthetics):
		*You will receive neither a penalty nor bonus for making a decent to look at script that doesn't stand out.  I don't want to tip things in the favor of advanced scripters too much.
		-Score bonus for going above and beyond to make something beautiful: +4% if applied to individual attack score; +2% if applied to overall script score
		-Score penalty for making poor aesthetic choices that make certain things hard to see or look at: -4% if applied to individual attack score; -2% if applied to overall script score
	
I will also do my best to provide commentary on every aspect of your script throughout my judging, pointing out things you did right and things you could
improve on.  I wouldn't call myself an expert, but these comments will just be my honest opinions and advice on what you could do for future scripts, or if you
wanted to improve your contest entry script after the contest.

***DISCLAIMER: Please don't get hurt if I give your script bad/mediocre scores.  I try to be as strict and objective as possible when scoring, so even scripts that I personally liked or thought
were pretty decent may still get "meh" scores from me.  I try not to sugarcoat things in the hopes that you can improve, and so long as you're willing to listen to advice, I have nothing but
respect for you.  Also, I'm just really really picky...  So please bear with me ^^; **

Difficulty judged: N/A

Nonspell 1: 3/10
	*While the blue bullets form an interesting pattern, the constant stream Minoriko fires just make this a very rudimentary streaming pattern.
	*The health bar is also quite long, as far as I can tell.

Spell 1 (Harvester Sign "Autumn Special Wheat"): 6/10
	*Even though the lasers seem to be static, the randomness in the bullet bursts make for interesting dodging while avoiding the lasers

Nonspell 2: 4/10
	*I'm not quite sure what you were going for with making those bullets "wiggle", but that at least makes their trajectory somewhat unpredictable, making	for a reasonably tense pattern

Spell 2 (Wheat Sign "Fabulous Wheat Crops"): 4/10
	*The concept is interesting, but while the danmaku is reasonable to dodge, it's not terribly interesting since it's mostly random

Nonspell 3: 4/10
	*This nonspell could potentially be interesting, but as it's set up now, it's extremely easy to avoid by simply staying still during the blue phase and sidestepping the red phase

Spell 3 (Harvest Sign "Strange Cherry Fruit"): 6/10
	*I have to admit that this spell is reasonably fun to dodge.  On the creative side, though, it's very "meh"
	*The bouncing red bullets bring in an interesting element, but aside from that it's just dodging random bullets

Nonspell 4: 2/10
	*This nonspell is COMPLETELY static and makes the exact same pattern every single wave.  If you have homing shots, you could move off to the side and easily safespot.
	*If you don't, however, you have to stay beneath Minoriko and dodge a pattern that requires micrododging to survive over and over and over...

Spell 4 (Plenty Sign "Sweet Baked Potatoes"): 4/10
	*Not a bad concept, but it gets stale really fast with dodging the same thing over and over--it's just a simple streaming/misdirection pattern

Spell 5 ("Harvester God's Rage"): 6/10
	*This spell is reasonably fun, and it could be even more so with some refinements to the danmaku and added variety of patterns, rather than simple bouncing bullets to go alongside the streaming bullets.  
	*Perhaps have the aimed streams move in different directions as well to require different dodging patterns?

Average Score: 39/90 = 43.33%

FINAL SCORE: 8.67/20

Final Comments:
	-You seem to rely a bit too much on randomness for some of your bullet patterns.  While randomness in small doses can be helpful, using it too much can stifle creativity
	-Try to also avoid completely static patterns, or patterns that barely change over time
