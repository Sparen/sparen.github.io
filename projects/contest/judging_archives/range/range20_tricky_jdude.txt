RaNGE 20 - JDude
 
For this contest I'll continue using a 20-point rating system. Points will be divided as follows:
 
Danmaku Quality: 12/20
 
Danmaku Quality encompasses the quality of the danmaku in your script. "Good" patterns will equal a "good" score in this category. What makes a pattern good is subjective, but the #1 factor is fun. A flashy, gorgeous pattern that isn't fun won't fare well here. Note that aesthetic factors can still factor into this - proper usage of sound effects and graphics can make an unfair pattern fair, and improper usage of those can make an otherwise-fair pattern unfair.
 
Individual patterns will be rated out of 10. The average of that will be taken and scaled to calculate the Danmaku Quality score.
 
Aesthetics: 4/20
 
This category encompasses how your entry looks (and sounds). While danmaku should absolutely come first, visual and audio elements are also a part of the gameplay experience.
 
Adherence to the Seasonal Theme: 4/20
 
4 points will be dedicated to how seasonal your script feels. Things like color choices, pattern design and aesthetic factors all contribute to how "seasonal" a script feels.

Played with Ultima Reimu B.
 
Nonspell 1: I like how this pattern looks. It's much easier than it looks, though, but not entirely trivial. Neat. 7.5/10.
 
Spell 1: I'd like it a bit more if there were more method to the doll shots instead of being mostly random, but this is a good pattern too. Tough, but fair and fun. 8/10.

Nonspell 2: More boring than the previous nonspell. You definitely should render the smaller bullets above the larger ones since I managed to die once because an icicle(?) bullet popped out from under one. 6/10.
 
Spell 2: Good. Fun and fair. I initially thought it was a bit cheap, but after further review the dolls actually aren't that fast and it's easy enough to get out of their way. 8.5/10.
 
Nonspell 3: A bit of an oddball pattern. Can take a while if you trap yourself in a corner since the lasers take a while to go away and the rings of arrowheads probably shouldn't just be recklessly run through. Not bad though. 6.75/10.
 
Spell 3: Simple and effective criss-cross heck. It's not all THAT interesting, but it's a fun enough pattern. 7.5/10.
 
Nonspell 4: The lasers make it feel pretty summery. Also a good pattern. The pacing feels a little bit off but it's not that bad, and the gaps might be a little small. 7.75/10.
 
Spell 4: Is really just dodging a bunch of sporadic explosions. The pacing is a bit weird (there's a lot of waiting between waves) and it's not that interesting of a pattern. 5/10.
 
Spell 5: I thought the Fall doll was pretty easy, the Winter doll was mostly just random spam, the Spring doll was a bit cheap, then easy once you know it's coming, and the Summer doll was by far the best one. Overall it's a neat idea, but the patterns could use some improvement. 6/10.

Danmaku Score: 7/10 (scaled to 8.4/12)
======================================================================================================================
 
Aesthetically average. I thought the scrolling seasons were honestly pretty tacky-looking and the bullet overlap during the winter nonspell was a pretty bad thing to do. On the other hand, some effort was put into other elements to balance out those flaws. 2/4.
======================================================================================================================
 
This script does a pretty good job of fitting the theme. Good work. 3.25/4
 
OVERALL SCORE 8.4 + 2 + 3.25 = 13.65/20
