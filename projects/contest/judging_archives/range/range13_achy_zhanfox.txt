Danmaku Quality: 4.8/8 Nothing too bad here, Kaguya's curvy lasers are a bit boring and rather cheap in some cases, and there's room for more improvement. I saw some nice ideas in there though.

Contest Theme: 5.8/8 I'm not sure what you were going for with Kaguya's opposite ability, perhaps I'm just misunderstanding what you mean by "emptiness"? Regardless I see some of her attack nature in this script, so that's good. Mokou seemed to start using fireballs at some points, but since it acted like water more often I'll let that go. Other than that I think you did good representing water-Mokou!

Music, Graphics, Appeal: 2.7/4 The characters make sounds during the dialog...I like it! I like the edit of blue fireball bullets into water bullets, I think that worked out well.
