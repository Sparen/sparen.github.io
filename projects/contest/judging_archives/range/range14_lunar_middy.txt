[Midnight Sparkle] Mokou (Default Difficulty)

[Danmaku = 5.60/10]
Patterns definitely fit mokou but more so too random
while some of these are ZUN patterns stacked up each other
Im not saying its bad however, its still pretty so ill give it merits

[Balancing = 1/2]
hmmm this script encourages macro and micrododging everywhere
that affects difficulty and with no sound cues, its much harder
work on sounds please, even music

[Aesthetics = 3.5/5]
Considering this not made in danmakufu, its unique
in this case Aesthetics would probably mean nothing because
its the simplest of the simple but, again considering
its not danmakufu its well done albeit completely static

[Overall Enjoyment = 0.70/3]

[Final Score = 10.8/20]
The script has its merits, but its most certainly lacks in enjoyment
a couple of sounds would have been nice, heck music even but
with that said Danmaku has quality but you should make it more
interesting since its giving the idea you copied off ZUN
