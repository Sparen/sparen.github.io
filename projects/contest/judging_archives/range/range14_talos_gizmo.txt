-Danmaku- (15 point)

Non-spell 1 :
Such a decent opening nonspell.
[12/15]

Tengu Blade "Claw of the White Wolf"
I must say I love this. It give me the feeling of "White Wolf" very well, and it's the best spell in this script.
[17.5/20]

Non-spell 2 :
Now this is such a big no-no. It's just a replicate version of non-spell 1 with the new pattern on the top (actually, it's from Double Spoiler). It looks very silly...and cheap.
[7/15]

Tengu Sign "White Wolf,Black Wolf"
I didn't know Momiji can do something like this, oh well.
Danmaku is fine, the "Illusion Momiji" should fire more danmaku,though. Right now, it's pretty lackluster.
[14/20]

Tengu Sign "Year of the Wolf-NewYear's Dawn-"
This looks a lot like Suwako's survival spell card, suffering unoriginality, but it has some potential, and it suit Momiji.
[14.5/20]

I Had to do this "Yam of the Wolf -I'm So Sorry!-"
What is this?. xD
I don't have any idea about this meme, so let's move to danmaku.
Momiji's shots are very brutal. They will definitely kill you on the first run (because 99% of player have no idea what to do)
The...umm...Yam is ok, though.
[13/20]

Overall, for the main boss fight you get 10.64 points out of 15

-Visual & Effect- (3 point)
Visual is ok. (Although, I'm surprise that you animated Tarumi sprite and left Momiji be a statue.
Effect is ok,too.
[1.5/3]

-Others (Difficulty,Aesthetics) - (2 point)
Difficulty is fair (except nonspell 2)
Good choice for music
[1/2]

Extra Credit (Stage,Midboss,Player,Gimmick,etc) (1 points).
At least you made 2 ending, one of them is pretty hilarious.
