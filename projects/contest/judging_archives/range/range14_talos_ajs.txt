-Danmaku- (15 point)

Tsundere Sign "Reluctant Love"
The fight begin with a serious pattern, and I must say you did a very good job with it.No cheapshot or surprised attack here.
[18.5/20] 

Trauma Sign "Lingering Memories"
This is kinda interesting to see.Although, there is not much to do here beside dodging every incoming bullets from every direction.
[17/20]

Subconscious Influence "Center of Attention"
What? THIS IS GENIUS.The danmaku, the gimmick. Dam, I love how you add a line that liken to enemy marker, making this spell card completely fair because I can still keep track of the boss while dodging danmaku.
[18.5/20]

Subconscious Repression "Retrograde Amnesia"
At first I though "Another serious spell card? this's starting to get boring", but when Koishi reincarnated, reversed my player's movement(also the theme), and bullets are starting to fly back, I was "huhhh?" and ..."OMG THIS IS AWESOME!" then had fun with the rest of pattern.
[19.5/20]

Mind Swap "Role Reversal"
Well, actually this isn't an original spell card, but the danmaku are original and fun.
(The moment when I press X and kill heroines with Koishi's hearts spamming spell card (or fists and anchors) is very satisfying.
[18.5/20]

Interface Screw "Attack on HUD"
I'm sorry I can't describe this spell card by words, except...hmmm maybe danmaku could be a bit better?
but WHO care for danmaku when the gimmick are absolutely brilliant!
[19/20]

Overall, for the main boss fight you get 13.86 points out of 15

-Visual & Effect- (3 point)
I don't need to explain anything with visual, it's good as it be.
Effects are gorgeous.
[2.75/3]

-Others (Difficulty,Aesthetics) - (2 point)
I only played hard & lunatic mode, and I've to say you did a good job with difficulty. The last spell card is pretty overkill though.
The music, the dialogue, fit the fight very well.
[1.75/2]

Extra Credit (Stage,Midboss,Player,Gimmick,etc) (1 points)
Do I have to say more?
[1/1]
