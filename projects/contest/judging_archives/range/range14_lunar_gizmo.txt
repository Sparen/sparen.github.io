[Gizmo] Momiji (Default Difficulty)

[Danmaku = 4.90/10]
there are many things here that wall you,specifically the wolf fang
coming down the ceiling on the second nonspell, I like how you incorporate it
into all this but those are walls and comes by too fast and the
last spell card was too anticlimactic, its fast , walls you, and yet it does not
live up to it being the last spell card, And what is with the Yam! :V

[Balancing = 0.90/2]
If you look at it , everything looks to easy...but its not
theres are parts of this where it was all dependant on momiji's
movement if you die or not

[Aesthetics = 2.20/5]
Pretty solid Aesthetics, the no spell card background bothers me
other than that I see no error and it definitely doesnt look bad
