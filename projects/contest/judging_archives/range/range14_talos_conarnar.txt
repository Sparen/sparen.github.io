-Danmaku- (15 point)

Non-spell 1 :
Very nice colour here, and pattern is solid.
[12/15]

Insanity "Vision Shifting"
At first I don't know what's going on here, but I can still barely dodge most of bullets. Once I knew the gimmick, this spell card become quite fun.
[17.5/20]

Non-spell 2 :
A good looking non-spell, also fun. Although I dislike the green & yellow colour here. They blend with the background.
[12.5/15]

Afterimage "Mind Film"
Brilliant pattern, totally original, totally fun.
[18.5/20]

Non-spell 3 :
This pattern justify Reisen's non-spell. Fast de-accelerated bullets are always fun to dodge.
[13/15]

Insanity "Illusionary Fear"
My god. This is magnificent, simply awesome.
[19/20]

Lunatic Eyes "Wave Distortion"
A good way to end the battle. Love the pattern and effect you use here
[17/20]

Overall, for the main boss fight you get 13.14 points out of 15

-Visual & Effect- (3 point)
Background is very nice, other things are good,too
Effect is pretty, still not much
[2.25/3]

-Others (Difficulty,Aesthetics) - (2 point)
Difficulty is quite balanced, nice job.
Music fit the fight well.
[1.75/2]

Extra Credit (Stage,Midboss,Player,Gimmick,etc) (1 points).
Midboss is good enough, but you also have 2 players and each of them have custom shot 
for both unfocused and focus. Moreover, they both have custom spell cards. Are you crazy? o_O
[1/1]
