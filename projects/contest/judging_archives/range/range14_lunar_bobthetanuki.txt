[Bob] Parsee (Default Difficulty)

[Danmaku = 5.80/10]
You put a nice twist to parsee, and you handled it so proffesionally
great job, and I like the fact that you incorparate Parsee's status as a bridge princess into
the spells well while also giving a nod to Parsee's original spells in SA,
What I DONT like is how Parsee just OHKO'd me by being on top of me on the 3rd Spell
and the Final Spell is a survival?????? .-.

[Balancing = 1.20/2]
for a single difficulty you hold no boundaries, the patterns looks so dense
yet manages to become easier or atleast not traumatizing

[Aesthetics = 4/5]
So pretty, the fact that you incorporate your effects into patterns
just make it all the more stunning great job

[Overall Enjoyment = 1.90/3]

[Final Score = 12.9/20]
This was great, you incorporated something different to parsee
while still able to take notes from her Original SA fight
difficulty wise theres too much bullets even on the first nonspell
it gives the impression of the whole script being hard, which ended up to be the case
