Harvest Crisis - by Zhan Fox

AJS's Supercool Judging System!

* My focus is on fun factor, fairness, and challenge of the danmaku.  Aesthetics will be a MINOR component to reward going the extra mile or punish bad design choices.
* I will score your entry based on the difficulty that is most "playable" for me (typically somewhere around Normal/Hard) while still being fun and fair
	** I will not factor in how well your difficulty settings are balanced, however.  That'd just kinda complicate things.
	** It would still be to your benefit to make balanced difficulties though--or at least more than one--so I can find a difficulty most suited to me for scoring

My scoring system will be as such:
	>0 -- Unplayable (i.e. broken, extremely buggy, etc.)
	>1 -- Terrible/No effort
	>2 -- Bad
	>3 -- Needs work
	>4 -- Has potential
	>5 -- Average
	>6 -- Okay
	>7 -- Decent
	>8 -- Good
	>9 -- VERY good
	>10 -- One of the best things I've seen

		-Stage portion (if you have one): X/10
		-Each nonspell (midboss included): X/10
		-Each spell card (midboss included): X/10
	*All scores will then be averaged, then multiplied by 2 to give a final score of XX.XX/20.00
	*Aesthetic bonus 
	(May be applied to individual pattern scores for making especially pretty/eye-sore attacks, or to overall score for general script aesthetics):
		*You will receive neither a penalty nor bonus for making a decent to look at script that doesn't stand out.  I don't want to tip things in the favor of advanced scripters too much.
		-Score bonus for going above and beyond to make something beautiful: +4% if applied to individual attack score; +2% if applied to overall script score
		-Score penalty for making poor aesthetic choices that make certain things hard to see or look at: -4% if applied to individual attack score; -2% if applied to overall script score
	
I will also do my best to provide commentary on every aspect of your script throughout my judging, pointing out things you did right and things you could
improve on.  I wouldn't call myself an expert, but these comments will just be my honest opinions and advice on what you could do for future scripts, or if you
wanted to improve your contest entry script after the contest.

***DISCLAIMER: Please don't get hurt if I give your script bad/mediocre scores.  I try to be as strict and objective as possible when scoring, so even scripts that I personally liked or thought
were pretty decent may still get "meh" scores from me.  I try not to sugarcoat things in the hopes that you can improve, and so long as you're willing to listen to advice, I have nothing but
respect for you.  Also, I'm just really really picky...  So please bear with me ^^; **

Difficulty judged: N/A

Stage: 7/10
	*While a bit easy at times, it provides just enough excitement to make things interesting
	*The stage also doesn't overstay its welcome either

Shizuha Nonspell: 5/10
	*A fairly standard pattern, not too threatening but the yellow shots make for good obstacles as the waves overlap

Shizuha Spell (Autumn Breeze "Momiji Leaf-fall"): 9/10
	*I LOVE THIS ATTACK!!!
	*The only reason I'm not giving it a 10 is because Shizuha's healthbar is reaaalllly long for this attack. And this coupled with her movement means it takes a long time to end this attack
	
Minoriko Nonspell 1: 5/10
	*The tomato bullets are reasonably threatening, but otherwise this is just a rehash of one of Minoriko's canon attacks

Minoriko Spell 1 (Goddess Sign "Inari in a Form of a Fox"): 4/10
	*This attack feels rather barren, with only the lasers posing a threat to the player
	*I would suggest supplementing the lasers with another layer of attack

Minoriko Nonspell 2: 6/10
	*Simple, but effective.  It does its job well, and doesn't overstay its welcome
	*-10 points for making me hungry :( [jk, of course]

Minoriko Spell 2 (Secret "The Principle of Harvest"): 5/10
	*It feels like a ripoff of Flandre's "Kagome-Kagome" spell
	*However, the fruit attacks add an interesting dimension to the attack

Minoriko Nonspell 3: 6/10
	*Another simple but effective nonspell
	
Minoriko Spell 3 (Plenty Sign "Exotic Dance of Harvest Gods"): 7/10
	*While simple in execution, it's a fairly fun and chaotic attack to dodge
	*I do wish a bit more could have been done with it though, as there's not much to it

Minoriko Nonspell 4: 5/10
	*Decently fun to dodge, but rather simplistic
	
Minoriko Spell 4 (Hunt for Fuits "Rare Catch"): 3/10
	*I'm not entirely fond of spells where the boss just constantly follows you while shooting bullets
	*In addition, she's just firing random bullets.  The spell feels dull and drags on way too long

Minoriko Spell 5 (Harvest Crisis "Morning Prayer to Gods"): 8/10
	*I REALLY like this concept, and it's very fun and challenging!
	*If I were to make some suggestions, I would recommend decreasing the laser count but increasing the laser speed, because early on the lasers typically end up blowing up the fruits before they barely come on screen
	*It'd be nice if the gimmick of the player using the lasers to chop up fruits was embraced a little more fully, which could perhaps be done with the above suggestion
	*It also gets a biiiiiit too chaotic near the end
	*But overall, I really like the idea of this spell! :D


Average Score: 70/120 = 58.33% + [2% AESTHETIC BONUS] = 60.33%

FINAL SCORE: 12.01/20

Final Comments:
	-Aesthetic-wise, this script was GORGEOUS!  And the ending was adorable--props to whoever drew those!
	-The danmaku was quite fun, and I got a good laugh out of the various fruits and veggies danmaku
	-However, some attacks I felt were lazily designed or dragged on too long
	-That, I think, is your biggest weakness.  But you definitely have a lot of potential, as some of your best attacks were really fun for me.
