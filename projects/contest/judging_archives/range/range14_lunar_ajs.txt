[AJS] Koishi (Lunatic Mode)

[Danmaku = 8.5/10]
There's two types of danmaku in this script, Serious Danmaku and Joke Danmaku
Honestly im gonna minus a bit of points because of the joke danmaku but You do
deliver when it comes to serious danmaku, these are definitely some of the most
challenging Koishi spell card I have ever played and I am counting the Role Reversal Card
You only made it fun but you kept adding interesting things to keep the whole thing from getting
stale I like that, good job

[Balancing = 1.4/2]
Maybe it's just Lunatic mode or I just suck at playing this because I've died more times
Per Card, thankfully it counts deaths not lives, but still 5 deaths per second is just
what Clownpiece did and that was not fun

[Aesthetics = 4.3/5]
Yes, it's pretty , its gorgeous, my god I don't to say more how
pretty this whole thing is, though the graphics had a problem with the zoom in spell

[Overall Enjoyment = 2.2/3]

[Final Score = 16.4/20]
This is one of the highest quality scripts I've seen in this contest
it may look like a joke at the end but when It comes for something serious
It definitely was planned well you made it fun and interesting yet serious enough
For a contest
