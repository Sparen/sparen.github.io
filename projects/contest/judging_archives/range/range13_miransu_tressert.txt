It seems that the script is currently fluctuating between Extra and Hard mode, with no difference in difficulty (I hear it's going to be fixed in a later version, but the version I played is the one I will judge. The stage is something I like quite a bit. There are multiple elements of patterns from the canon games, which is a nice touch. Cirno's patterns are executed fairly well. The rows of stationary fire bullets in her spell have a strange collision detection.
Marisa has many nice ideas, and the danmaku stays true to Marisa's character too, but the patterns themselves are rather poorly balanced. Besides the difficulty issues, though, this script is very well done.
