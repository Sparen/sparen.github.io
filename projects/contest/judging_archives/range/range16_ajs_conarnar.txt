Wriggle - by Conarnar

AJS's Supercool Judging System!

* My focus is on fun factor, fairness, and challenge of the danmaku.  Aesthetics will be a MINOR component to reward going the extra mile or punish bad design choices.
* I will score your entry based on the difficulty that is most "playable" for me (typically somewhere around Normal/Hard) while still being fun and fair
	** I will not factor in how well your difficulty settings are balanced, however.  That'd just kinda complicate things.
	** It would still be to your benefit to make balanced difficulties though--or at least more than one--so I can find a difficulty most suited to me for scoring

My scoring system will be as such:
	>0 -- Unplayable (i.e. broken, extremely buggy, etc.)
	>1 -- Terrible/No effort
	>2 -- Bad
	>3 -- Needs work
	>4 -- Has potential
	>5 -- Average
	>6 -- Okay
	>7 -- Decent
	>8 -- Good
	>9 -- VERY good
	>10 -- One of the best things I've seen

		-Stage portion (if you have one): X/10
		-Each nonspell (midboss included): X/10
		-Each spell card (midboss included): X/10
	*All scores will then be averaged, then multiplied by 2 to give a final score of XX.XX/20.00
	*Aesthetic bonus 
	(May be applied to individual pattern scores for making especially pretty/eye-sore attacks, or to overall score for general script aesthetics):
		*You will receive neither a penalty nor bonus for making a decent to look at script that doesn't stand out.  I don't want to tip things in the favor of advanced scripters too much.
		-Score bonus for going above and beyond to make something beautiful: +4% if applied to individual attack score; +2% if applied to overall script score
		-Score penalty for making poor aesthetic choices that make certain things hard to see or look at: -4% if applied to individual attack score; -2% if applied to overall script score
	
I will also do my best to provide commentary on every aspect of your script throughout my judging, pointing out things you did right and things you could
improve on.  I wouldn't call myself an expert, but these comments will just be my honest opinions and advice on what you could do for future scripts, or if you
wanted to improve your contest entry script after the contest.

***DISCLAIMER: Please don't get hurt if I give your script bad/mediocre scores.  I try to be as strict and objective as possible when scoring, so even scripts that I personally liked or thought
were pretty decent may still get "meh" scores from me.  I try not to sugarcoat things in the hopes that you can improve, and so long as you're willing to listen to advice, I have nothing but
respect for you.  Also, I'm just really really picky...  So please bear with me ^^; **

Difficulty judged: N/A

Nonspell 1: 7/10
	*The pellets are fun to dodge, but the intermediary phase where Wriggle shoots the round bullets feels very trivial--it poses no threat, and is mostly gone by the time the next pellet wave begins
	
Spell 1 (Lamp Sign "Unreasonable Firefly Light"): 8/10
	*Beautiful, challenging, and fun to dodge
	*I would've appreciated a bit more variety other than basically the same pattern each wave, but it's short enough that it's not too big an issue
	
Nonspell 2: 7/10
	*You probably should have had Wriggle start with just one element at a time before firing them both at once.  It can easily catch one off-guard when they're both coming at you simultaneously
	*However, once you figure it out, it's a pretty fun nonspell!
	
Spell 2 (Firefly Sign "Constellation on Earth"): 10/10
	*This spell's totally chaotic and nuts...  but in a good way!
	*I'm actually quite impressed by how you managed to keep it so fair and manageable despite looking so dazzling and intimidating
	*I keep wondering how the hell I'm dodging all that stuff, but I keep doing it consistently, so I'm sure it's no fluke.  That's good game design, my friend. :)

Nonspell 3: 9/10
	*This nonspell's deceptively simple, but it's surprisingly fun to dodge
	*I really like how you give the player time to get out of the way of the dodged blasts
	*But even so, getting out of their way isn't necessarily a cakewalk, so it doesn't feel trivial
	
Spell 3 (Wriggle Sign "Firefly Abnormality"): 8/10
	*The pellets are really fun to dodge, especially when they condense.  But be a bit careful with randomness, I got practically walled by them once (and then never again, oddly enough...)
	*The aimed shots don't play as much of a role as I would've hoped, since they mostly fire during the easy part and stop before things get challenging
	
Nonspell 4: 3/10
	*Compared to your previous amazing nonspells, this feels like a big letdown, I'm sorry to say :/
	*The lasers and bullet streams are very trivial to dodge, making the pattern feel rather boring
	
Spell 4 (Lamp Sign "Firefly Glow"): 6.24/10
	*Hey you stole my gimmick! :P (jk)
	*The gimmick is interesting but reasonable, though I feel the danmaku lacks variety and gets stale after a while
	*I really appreciate the fact that the familiars stop firing if they pass directly over you, though
	*If you had made multiple difficulties, I would've recommended making the "light auras" of those familiars smaller, to make things a bit more challenging.  Cuz as it is now, the darkness is kinda more of a nuisance than an actual obstacle facing the player ;P
	*[+4% AESTHETIC BONUS] for the cool darkness mechanic

Spell 5 (Insect Attracting Light "Selenic Deity"): 7/10
	*Pretty standard for a final spell card, but pretty fun once it gets to the final phases
	*Kudos for not letting it get TOO crazy near the end, keeping it challenging but reasonable the whole way through


Average Score: 65.24/90 = 72.49% + [2% AESTHETIC BONUS] = 74.49%

FINAL SCORE: 14.90/20

Final Comments:
	-I gave you the Aesthetic Bonus because while you didn't have that many flashy effects, I really like all the customization you have for the players (as is standard for your scripts :P)
	-I really liked your danmaku overall!  It was challenging, but very fair for the most part.  And the patterns also felt very Wriggle-like
