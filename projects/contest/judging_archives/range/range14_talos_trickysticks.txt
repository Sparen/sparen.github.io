-Danmaku- (15 point)

Non-spell 1 :
I like this. You executed knives danmaku very well.
[13/15]

Unwind "Still Life"
Good,fun and fair pattern. You showed how pattern work at start of spell card, which is a plus
[18/20]

Non-spell 2 :
Familiar do the right job.
[13/15]

Inflate "Diffuse Density"
Good use of delay cloud here, a pattern is fun,but blue wave should be executed better
[16.5/20]

Non-spell 3 :
I don't like how Familiars fire bullet much. Aimed shots from Sakuya is quite fun to dodge,though.
[12/15]

Coujuring "Killing Doll's Accomplices"
A pretty pretty spell card. I've a fun time redirecting those knives while dodging kunai bullets.
[17.5/20]

No Trick "Death Lotus"
Final spell card, which is your weakness. It's too easy compare to the entire fight. Blue knives don't seem to do anything, except limiting your movement (not like you will move much anyway)
[15.5/20]


Overall, for the main boss fight you get 12.66 points out of 15
