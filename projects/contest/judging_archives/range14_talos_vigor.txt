-Danmaku- (15 point)

Non-spell 1 :
An intermediate pattern. Red waves almost got me on the first run. (I also noticed their speed shift between fast and slow, nice detail here.) [12/15]

Spell 1 :
A good looking pattern. Danmaku seem fine and well balanced. Although, there's not much content here except rainbow bullets everywhere [16/20]

Non-spell 2 :
Those cycle bullets are a bit too fast. Otherwise, another good pattern [11.5/15]

Spell 2 :
I like the way you spawn bullets, then they collapse together and spawn more bubbles. Very cool looking pattern [16.5/20]

Non-spell 3 :
Look like a recreated of non-spell 2 , with more speedy bullets and more cheapshots. I don't approve. [9/15]

Spell 3 :
The first phase is well done, not much in the second phase ,though. I always get instantly killed by purple lasers.
It would be a lot better if you increase the delay of lasers in the second phase.[13/20]

Spell 4 :
It's good, but it look a lot like the recreated of spell 2. [13.5/20]

Spell 5 :
Again, it look like you merge spell 2 and spell 3 together.The result is somewhat pleasing,but things are starting to get repetitive. [15/20]

Overall, for the main boss fight you get 11.02 points out of 15

-Visual & Effect- (3 point)
Amazing background & amazing charge/burst effect. Nice job here
[2.75/3]

-Others (Difficulty,Aesthetics) - (2 point)
Difficulty is varied between normal-hard with some cheapshots here and there.
There is no boss aura, magic circle, or enemy marker, making it very hard to keep track of the boss while dodging danmaku
[0.5/2]

Extra Credit (Stage,Midboss,Player,Gimmick,etc) (1 points).
Don't seem to have any.
