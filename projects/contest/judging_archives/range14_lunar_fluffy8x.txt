[Danmaku = 3.20/10]
I just dont get how the danmaku goes here.
There are random cheapshots everywhere, some too fast
some too slow and the survival card isnt interesting either
and it seems that your stage is immitating SA Extra but i might be wrong

[Balancing = 0.50/2]
It seems like you pay little to no attention to
the balancing of the script. I'll leave it at that

[Aesthetics = 2.1/5]
Ok the bullets are ok but the enemy graphics
are...well....sure its ok it works but this is too simple

[Overall Enjoyment = 1/3]

[Final Score = 6.8/20]
the patterns are too simple and too random and cheapshot is present
the graphics needs some works and music is too low of a volume plus
the lack of sound effects.
