-Danmaku- (15 point)

Non-spell 1 :
I like this. It's quite good for marisa non-spell.
[12.5/15]

Light Conversion "Aurora to Moonlight"
Pretty neat concept. Good execution on star bullets. My only complaint is that Marisa is very hard to hit
[16/20]

Non-spell 2 :
It's ok. I know there're some of patterns there,but overall it still look a bit random
[12/15]

Stargazing "Past View from the Present"
The first phase where Marisa swapping places with other familiar is perplexed. I don't understand the gimmick behind them
I mean... there're 3 familiars and Marisa. For each wave, 1/4 of them will fire danmaku, but I don't know WHICH one will fire. Sometimes, it got me because I was standing right there
(I'm sorry if there's some trick behind this, but I failed to see them)
The second phase is refreshing. Although, not much go on there except the bursts of red stars/green pellets/blue pellets/whatever came to you at the same time.Nevertheless, I love the way you manipulated the lasers to form a square border. Pretty fun to watch.
[15.5/20]

Non-spell 3 :
This non-spell can provide some beautiful danmaku, but sadly it ruined by the speed of familiar.Oh well, it's still good.
[11.5/15]

Passion Sign "Master Flare"
The final spell is the weakest. Even though I do like the "Master Flare" effect here, I must say this spell is kinda bad. The screen shaking effect, combine with shiny bullets everywhere, making it impossible to see and dodge. 
[13/20]

Overall, for the main boss fight you get 11.5 points out of 15

-Visual & Effect- (3 point)
Visual look pretty, but stage background could use some work.
There's no charge effect here, but I think you're fine without it already.
[1.75/3]

-Others (Difficulty,Aesthetics) - (2 point)
Difficulty is clearly hard mode. (except final spell, which is lunatic)
Almost every pattern is fair. Nice job.
Music choice is questionable. I will leave that to individual,though.
[1.25/2]

Extra Credit (Stage,Midboss,Player,Gimmick,etc) (1 points).
Don't seem to have any.

##### Final Score = 11.5+1.75+1.25 = 14.50 #####
