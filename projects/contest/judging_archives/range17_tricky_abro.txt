Trickysticks here, judging another contest. Yay. This one involves lasers everywhere and only lasers.

Scripts will be judged solely on gameplay. While the danmaku is the vast majority of this category, things like sound effects and graphic design choices do affect how the game plays. Scores will be calculated by rating every pattern out of 10, then taking the average of those values.
 
This review is for A Bro's contest entry.

Opening Yellow Laser Thing: This is pretty cheap, honestly, but okay once you know what's going to happen. Pretty hard, but doable with good reflexes. 4/10.

Nonspell 1: It's simple but challenging and feels pretty fun. I think it's pretty good. 7/10.

Spell 1: I like the idea but I think it's simply too difficult, especially compared to the first two attacks. Having to find and remember safe spaces is neat, but the Parallelogram shifts very quickly. The laser hitboxes are a bit unforgiving and it's easy to just-slightly position wrong and die. 4/10.

Spell 2: The randomly aimed curvy lasers just make this spell a bit too hard and unfair for my liking. It seems to be up to luck whether or not you can clear this spell - I only got to the phase with the horizontal yellow laser twice and the lifebar is REALLY long. The cheeto laser-esque things are basically the bullets that determine whether you get hit or not and they're random. A good idea with bad execution. 3/10.

If there's anything past the second spell, I wouldn't know because I can't get past that spell myself. As such judging will end here.

Score: 4.5/10
