Hopemetal's CC Entry:

Danmaku Quality: 3/8 "A lot of bullets are too fast for me. ;_; 

I can tell it's too fast for other players too though."
Perhaps a little bit too much randomness. I like the way the knifes work is "Metal Sign [Sawed in half]" I think it's the best put together spell.

Contest Theme: 4/8 "Tewi doesn't feel like she belongs, she's just kinda there in most spells, however in her own spellcard, I can see what her opposite ability is. With Patchouli on the other hand, you'd need to explain what exactly is opposite. 

Graphics, Music, and Appeal: 2/4 The way Tewi and Patchy leave at the end amuses me. The timing that they both move makes the situation of them leaving feel more awkward. I personally don't mind that there's not music or a background, I won't subtract points for their absence.
