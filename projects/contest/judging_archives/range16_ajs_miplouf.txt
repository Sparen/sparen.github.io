Unexpected Mastermind - by Miplouf

AJS's Supercool Judging System!

* My focus is on fun factor, fairness, and challenge of the danmaku.  Aesthetics will be a MINOR component to reward going the extra mile or punish bad design choices.
* I will score your entry based on the difficulty that is most "playable" for me (typically somewhere around Normal/Hard) while still being fun and fair
	** I will not factor in how well your difficulty settings are balanced, however.  That'd just kinda complicate things.
	** It would still be to your benefit to make balanced difficulties though--or at least more than one--so I can find a difficulty most suited to me for scoring

My scoring system will be as such:
	>0 -- Unplayable (i.e. broken, extremely buggy, etc.)
	>1 -- Terrible/No effort
	>2 -- Bad
	>3 -- Needs work
	>4 -- Has potential
	>5 -- Average
	>6 -- Okay
	>7 -- Decent
	>8 -- Good
	>9 -- VERY good
	>10 -- One of the best things I've seen

		-Stage portion (if you have one): X/10
		-Each nonspell (midboss included): X/10
		-Each spell card (midboss included): X/10
	*All scores will then be averaged, then multiplied by 2 to give a final score of XX.XX/20.00
	*Aesthetic bonus 
	(May be applied to individual pattern scores for making especially pretty/eye-sore attacks, or to overall score for general script aesthetics):
		*You will receive neither a penalty nor bonus for making a decent to look at script that doesn't stand out.  I don't want to tip things in the favor of advanced scripters too much.
		-Score bonus for going above and beyond to make something beautiful: +4% if applied to individual attack score; +2% if applied to overall script score
		-Score penalty for making poor aesthetic choices that make certain things hard to see or look at: -4% if applied to individual attack score; -2% if applied to overall script score
	
I will also do my best to provide commentary on every aspect of your script throughout my judging, pointing out things you did right and things you could
improve on.  I wouldn't call myself an expert, but these comments will just be my honest opinions and advice on what you could do for future scripts, or if you
wanted to improve your contest entry script after the contest.

***DISCLAIMER: Please don't get hurt if I give your script bad/mediocre scores.  I try to be as strict and objective as possible when scoring, so even scripts that I personally liked or thought
were pretty decent may still get "meh" scores from me.  I try not to sugarcoat things in the hopes that you can improve, and so long as you're willing to listen to advice, I have nothing but
respect for you.  Also, I'm just really really picky...  So please bear with me ^^; **

Difficulty judged: Memetic

Stage: 6/10
	*The stage is rather short so there's not too much to go on here
	*But the fairies immediately after Yukari are quite fun, as is the death fairy

Yukari Nonspell 1: 9/10
	*Pretty, reasonably challenging and interesting, but also very fair
	*Not much more to say here~
	
Yukari Spell 1 (Yakumo's Nest "Hyperactive Flying Objects"): 8.32/10
	*The delay between the indicator laser disappearing and the actual laser arriving forces the player to remember where the lasers are coming from and plan accordingly.  I like that!
	*While the danmaku Yukari herself shoots is more than enough to do the job, I still wish you could've done a bit more with it
	*Those lasers effects are GORGEOUS. [+4% AESTHETIC BONUS]

Yukari Spell 2 (Dual Lights "Doppler Effect"): 7.28/10
	*A decently fun spell to dodge, but I really feel you could've done more with it
	*Perhaps you could've had Yukari speed up the firing of the spinning waves over time, or had more overlap with the kunai waves
	*The effects on the bubbles look really cool and trippy [+4% AESTHETIC BONUS]
	
Yukari Spell 3 (Balance "Frontier of Movement and Stasis"): 8/10
	*Fun to dodge, and very fair while also challenging
	*I feel it drags on a bit long though, owing to the fact that Yukari moves around quite a bit and you yourself are forced to move so much

Rumia Nonspell 1: 3/10
	*The patterns are very simple and easy to avoid, leaving much to be desired

Rumia Spell 1 (Luminescence "Radiant Moonlight"): 4/10
	*The concept of dodging spirals of danmaku while avoiding the spinning lasers is nice, but in execution it just ended up being way too easy.  The lasers were hardly a threat at all, even with the spiral danmaku coming at you

Rumia Nonspell 2: 2/10
	*Dodging this is as simple as >move to the huge gap in the bullets, >stream the lasers, >repeat
	*Really boring, sorry to say

Rumia Spell 2 (Dark Line "Dusk Splitter"): 4/10
	*Once again, the idea was sound, but in execution it just ended up being rather dull and easy

Rumia Nonspell 3: 4/10
	*The dark bullets do occasionally make some patterns that are somewhat interesting to micrododge, but otherwise this pattern leaves much to be desired

Rumia Spell 3 (Unseen "Dark Side of the Moon"): 4/10
	*The part with the giant lasers spawning trails of bullets was interesting, and could've made for some interesting dodging in conjunction with the other danmaku
	*But as it is, it's still rather trivial to dodge.  And worse, the health bar was apparently so low that I finished it before she could even fire her second wave of lasers
	
Rumia Nonspell 4: 4/10
	*The green walls may have been more interesting to dodge if they overlapped with the green bullets phase, but otherwise it's rather boring

Rumia Spell 4 (Dark Bird "Midnight Flock"): 5/10
	*The laser spawning was really cool, and if supplemented with interesting bullet patterns, may have made a very interesting and fun spell card
	*As it is, the bullet patterns you currently have to support the lasers are really uninteresting
	
Rumia Spell 5 (Rainbow Decomposer "Dark Trinity"): 7/10
	*Fast-paced and fairly fun to dodge.
	*Sadly, this also ends fairly quickly before it can get a chance to shine :(
	
YUYUYUYUYUYUYUYUYUYUYUYUYU: 8/10
	*VERY fun to dodge, though gets a tad too chaotic by the end
	*The patterns you already provided were fun, but a bit more variety would've made this even better than it already was
	

Average Score: 83.6/150 = 55.73% + [2% AESTHETIC BONUS] = 57.73%

FINAL SCORE: 11.55/20

Final Comments:
	*Overall your script was fairly fun except for, unfortunately, the main attraction--Rumia--herself
	*With your Yukari and Yuyuko patterns, it's clear you intended this script to be of a higher difficulty.  So Rumia's very low-level and easy danmaku is inconsistent with the tone that they set
