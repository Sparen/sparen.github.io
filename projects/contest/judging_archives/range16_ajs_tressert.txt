Perfect Mastermind - by TresserT

AJS's Supercool Judging System!

* My focus is on fun factor, fairness, and challenge of the danmaku.  Aesthetics will be a MINOR component to reward going the extra mile or punish bad design choices.
* I will score your entry based on the difficulty that is most "playable" for me (typically somewhere around Normal/Hard) while still being fun and fair
	** I will not factor in how well your difficulty settings are balanced, however.  That'd just kinda complicate things.
	** It would still be to your benefit to make balanced difficulties though--or at least more than one--so I can find a difficulty most suited to me for scoring

My scoring system will be as such:
	>0 -- Unplayable (i.e. broken, extremely buggy, etc.)
	>1 -- Terrible/No effort
	>2 -- Bad
	>3 -- Needs work
	>4 -- Has potential
	>5 -- Average
	>6 -- Okay
	>7 -- Decent
	>8 -- Good
	>9 -- VERY good
	>10 -- One of the best things I've seen

		-Stage portion (if you have one): X/10
		-Each nonspell (midboss included): X/10
		-Each spell card (midboss included): X/10
	*All scores will then be averaged, then multiplied by 2 to give a final score of XX.XX/20.00
	*Aesthetic bonus 
	(May be applied to individual pattern scores for making especially pretty/eye-sore attacks, or to overall score for general script aesthetics):
		*You will receive neither a penalty nor bonus for making a decent to look at script that doesn't stand out.  I don't want to tip things in the favor of advanced scripters too much.
		-Score bonus for going above and beyond to make something beautiful: +4% if applied to individual attack score; +2% if applied to overall script score
		-Score penalty for making poor aesthetic choices that make certain things hard to see or look at: -4% if applied to individual attack score; -2% if applied to overall script score
	
I will also do my best to provide commentary on every aspect of your script throughout my judging, pointing out things you did right and things you could
improve on.  I wouldn't call myself an expert, but these comments will just be my honest opinions and advice on what you could do for future scripts, or if you
wanted to improve your contest entry script after the contest.

***DISCLAIMER: Please don't get hurt if I give your script bad/mediocre scores.  I try to be as strict and objective as possible when scoring, so even scripts that I personally liked or thought
were pretty decent may still get "meh" scores from me.  I try not to sugarcoat things in the hopes that you can improve, and so long as you're willing to listen to advice, I have nothing but
respect for you.  Also, I'm just really really picky...  So please bear with me ^^; **

Difficulty judged: Easyish (with some insight from Harder than Normal)

Stage: 8/10
	*The opening parts are decent, if not a bit underwhelming, and the midboss is fairly challenging despite being sorta static
	*What I really liked was the sequence with the falling yin-yang orbs and the indestructible red orbs, though.  It forced me to strategize and plan my way around

Nonspell 1: 7/10
	*Decent patterns, nothing special but contains lots of varied attacks.  I like that!
	
Spell 1 (Spirit Dance "Yuki Onna's Unseasonal Dance"): 8/10
	*An interesting and fun pattern to dodge, especially on higher difficulties
	*However, those semi-random grey "Murasa droplet" bullets that fire each wave are a bit too random for my taste, especially on higher difficulties where they can become a big pain
	
Nonspell 2: 10/10
	*A very unique style of nonspell that keeps the player on their toes while also being extremely fair
	*The slight randomness is just enough to keep the waves varied and the patterns fun!

Spell 2: 7/10
	*Despite your usage of BoWaP, this pattern is still fairly fun to dodge with BoWaP only acting as the support

Nonspell 3: 8/10
	*On higher difficulties this pattern's CRAZY.  But here, it strikes just the right balance of challenge and fairness

Spell 3: 9/10
	*I feel like a little bit more could have been done with this, but as it is it's a fun and interesting pattern to dodge

Nonspell 4: 9/10
	*A fun to dodge pattern, with the spiral walls forcing you to keep moving around

Spell 4 ("Flower Master of the Flowers of Winter"): 7/10
	*I feel the execution of this pattern was a bit lazy compared to your other patterns, with the semi-static yellow Yuuka-spirals you've got going
	*Granted, it's still decently fun to dodge.  But I wish you could have done more with the spiral--perhaps maybe occasionally have it complete a rotation?
	*Compared to your other varied patterns, this one just forces you to zig-zag back and forth

Spell 5 ("Perfect Winter Mastermind"): 9/10
	*This is what Miko's final attack in Ten Desires should have been more like.  While vertical streaming is the main component, you still add many different
	varieties to the patterns you have to dodge while doing so. And in addition, all the grazing you get from streaming complements your flashbomb system
	*However, some of the bullets that Letty herself can leave rather small gaps for the player to try to squeeze through
	

Average Score: 82/100 = 82.00% + [2% AESTHETIC BONUS] = 84.00%

FINAL SCORE: 16.80/20

Final Comments:
	-There's really not much I can say, you did a very good job with this whole script
	-Your difficulty settings are still nuts though >:U
