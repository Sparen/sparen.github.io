Crested judging for RaNGE 20: Four Colors of the Moon by Python.
Script contains 4 nonspells and 5 spells.
No difficulty selection. Only player is a custom Okina player.

I will be judging based on danmaku design, with a high focus on balance and creativity second.
Aesthetics are good and not distracting, so no penalty will be issued.

(sa2 gag in my touhou? disgusting)

Nonspell 1: Good ideas but the lasers spawn way too fast! With just an extra half second of the warning laser it'd be a good pattern.
14/20

"Scorched Ash of a Pristine Summer Sun": I hated the Komeiji's combo card in VD and this is worse
Seriously though when the orbs perfect line up into each others' gaps it's horrible (though it is doable)
The only actually unfair part is the sun's explosion.
13/20

Nonspell 2: Lanes transitioning into streaming, quite fun to dodge.
18/20

"Silent Wind Eddies in the Empty Streets": God fuck this spell
It's good though, even if i really really hate it
18/20

Nonspell 3: Nice Winter motif and fun to dodge.
18/20

"Glittering Ice Lotus Mandala": Very interesting idea and fairly well executed, though it seems to die quite fast before much can happen.
18/20

Nonspell 4: Fantastic nonspell. Very fun to dodge.
20/20

"A Pristinely Flowering Hell": Good spell but I'd have liked it to last much longer than it does.
17/20

Overall: 17/20
Very well-made script with highly creative patterns. Almost everything is a blind killer, but is actually quite fair.
