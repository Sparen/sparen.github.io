[TresserT] Reisen (Harder than Normal)

[Danmaku = 6.50/10]
I wont cover all the pattterns because overall both non and spell
patterns are all diverse and fits the characters
there are some Spell gimmicks that I have never even seen before which is great
but you should be careful with utilizing fast patterns
and those which encourages micrododging

[Balancing = 1.5/2]
the difficulty from easy to hard (normal ingame) is so drastic
It had me pulling my hair out just on harder than normal
please pay attention to how much danmaku should be onscreen
in correspondence to the difficulty level

[Aesthetics = 4.50/5]
this script is gorgeous,I dont see errors in the pattern spawning
stg frame, dialogue ,menu and effects all gorgeous
very well done

[Overall Enjoyment = 1.90/3]

[Final Score = 14.4/20]
the script has its ups and down but that difficulty is bringing it down
this is a short script you shouldn't have to replay over and over again
the finite 4 or 5 lives dont help either because of the difficulty
the patterns would eat up my lives
