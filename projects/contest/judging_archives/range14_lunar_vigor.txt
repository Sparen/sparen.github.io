[Danmaku = 5.90/10]
Wow this is quite the spectacle.However things are all over the place
theres definitely quality in danmaku though but some are too random
mostly the spells and if its the nons those bullets comes by too fast
and the bullets after it are even faster. And there are times where walls
are present.But i do like it though

[Balancing = 0.99/2]
There's just no balancing present at all, especially with bullets
coming at you at mach 10, almost all patterns are too fast for my liking
and I certainly died a lot. But im not gonna hold that out on you

[Aesthetics = 4.80/5]
Very Beautiful. Good Job, theres a unique spell background
and you incorporate the effects with your patterns
its gets full points for being gorgeous. Now if only
you'd put the spell name somewhere actually seeable... 

[Overall Enjoyment = 1.40/3]

[Final Score = 13.09/20]
This is a great script but, Danmaku style is pulling the enjoyment factor
Aesthetically, this is very gorgeous, all things are shiny and looks good
now I suggest you focus on patterns now instead of Effects
