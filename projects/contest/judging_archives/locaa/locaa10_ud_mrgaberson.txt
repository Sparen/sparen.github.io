Overall, a fun and servicable script. However, the nonspells are very bland, being nothing but yellow, and overall a little slow.
The spellcard names all run off the edge and loop oddly, too, making them a bit hard to read.

-Simple and cool looking nonspell, but feels very slow. The aimed shot doesn't really do much here, and it would have been nice to see more colour.

-I really like the concept to this one, but my main problem is that you will get cheapshotted by the lasers spawning the first time, no questions about it.
It comes into existenceright where Tsubakura's hitbox is if you're at the bottom of the screen, so that's kind of annoying. However, the dodging the blue walls
and the random stars is quite fun!

-I wish the lines were aimed at the player here. They're fast and come at a good pace, but they're random, so it just feels off. And again, they get lost in the see of
add rendered yellow.

-This spell falls a little flat because of it being seperated into segments, causing it to feel slow. The random stars bit feels especially slow.
Still, the aimed walls is an interesting attack, and I like the lines of bullets that the bubbles shoot out, and how they're aimed. It's cool, and makes dodging it interesting.
(still makes me think of PC-Alice)

-A nonspell that kind of happens. Again, the lines of bullets really should have been streamed. Otherwise, nothing too remarkably good or bad.

-A very nice spell, aesthetically, and it has a good concept! I wish the aimed lasers came more often or slower, because they all kind of spawn on each other.
In addition, it would have been nice if the stars weren't just random speeds and positions, and had some actual patterning to them. However, I like the 'net' bit, where
the lasers spawn at various points and make bullets.

-A survival, yay. The first and second waves are my favourite, as they're really fun to dodge, while the final wave is kind of bland and flavorless. And I get that Genbu
is the black turtle, but nothing but white bullets bothers me. This isn't Len'en (oh wait).
