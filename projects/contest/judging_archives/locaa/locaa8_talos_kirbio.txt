-Danmaku- (15 point)
 
Non-spell 1 :
I actually like this. The constant circle bullet combine with the acceleration fireballs is pretty satisfying to dodge. [8.5/10]

Forbidden Barrage "Dungeon of Misery"
Nice way to use the familiars. I especially like the exploding at the end. One thing that is subpar is the randomness of line bullets that familiars spawn. [12/15]

Non-spell 2 :
Bullets' speed is a bit slower than the 1st non-spell. It's still good though. The extra wave is ok but really easy to dodge. [8/10]

Purgatory "Flame of Gehenna"
Pretty good in term of misdirecting pattern. Look fair and fun. Although, I can't help but it feel a bit empty with only the circle bullet (aka Junko pattern) that Flandre shoot.
The pacing (less delay between each wave of bullets as time goes on) is nice, though. [12.5/15]

Non-spell 3 :
Solid non-spell. Don't really have much to say.[8/10]

Destructive Fate "The Tower of Major Arcana"
I've fun while dodging bullets from left and right. The extra familiars from Flandre did a good job,too. It's hardest spellcard in this script but it's also the best. :) [13.5/15]

Game of Life "Russian Roulette"
This spellcard...is obviously from a well-known fangame (Fantastic Danmaku Festival). It's too obvious and doesn't have any creativity in it, so no point for that. It's fun I can't denied, and I like how can I dodge inside the familiars ring. If we talk about creativity, it would be this part. xD [10.5/15]

"Chaos Universe"
It's really a chaos.The effects are also superb. The patterns are mostly good and well designed, but it's still not the best.
Some minor thing I noticed. The pattern on the 2nd wave is the mostly the same but bullet colors are different. It's a nice detail. Too bad before the 2nd wave start the pattern would likely end already. [13/15]
 
Danmaku Score =  (15/105)*(8.5+12+8+12.5+8+13.5+10.5+13) = 12.29
 
-Visual- (2 point)
The effects are gorgeous as well as stage background and spell background. I absolutely have no complaints. Great work so far.
[1.75/2]
 
-Music- (1 point)
It fits the flandre character for sure. [0.75/1]
 
-Difficulty- (1 point)
It's very well balanced. Cheapshot-free. Nice work. [0.75/1]
 
-Others- (1 point)
The players are neat. The dialogue is well-written. The ending is perfect. I like how you ask the player name so the replay can be saved properly. It's a smart move. [1/1]
 
Total Score : 12.29+1.75+0.75+0.75+1 = 16.54
