LOCAA 12 - Zino
 
For this contest I'll continue using a 20-point rating system. Points will be divided as follows:
 
Danmaku Quality: 10/20
 
Danmaku Quality encompasses the quality of the danmaku in your script. "Good" patterns will equal a "good" score in this category. What makes a pattern good is subjective, but the #1 factor is fun. A flashy, gorgeous pattern that isn't fun won't fare well here. Note that aesthetic factors can still factor into this - proper usage of sound effects and graphics can make an unfair pattern fair, and improper usage of those can make an otherwise-fair pattern unfair.
 
Individual patterns will be rated out of 10. The average of that will be taken to calculate the Danmaku Quality score.
 
Aesthetics: 4/20
 
This category encompasses how your entry looks (and sounds). While danmaku should absolutely come first, visual and audio elements are also a part of the gameplay experience.
 
Measure of Improvement: 6/20
 
6 points will be dedicated to how much you improved. This is entirely subjective, of course, but I'll comment about why I gave you the score that you received.
======================================================================================================================

Since this has difficulties I judged Hard mode yaaaay.

Nonspell 1: A bit plain, but plain isn't bad. 6/10.
 
Spell 1: I think the lasers could use a louder sound effect so it's more apparent that they're coming. The spell background changing into annoying shades of blue that match the bullets doesn't really help much either. 4.5/10.
 
Nonspell 2: You should definitely render bullets above your items. Otherwise, this is a bit easy but also fine. 6/10.
 
Spell 2: I'm not really sure what to do about the aimed phase of this survival. Otherwise it's neat, but that portion really is difficult to deal with and makes it not that fun. 5/10.

Spell 3: Around and around she goes. Where she stops, nobody knows. It's fine. 6.5/10.

Spell 4: Simple and effective and decently fun. 7.5/10.
 
Danmaku Average: 5.92/10
======================================================================================================================
 
In terms of aesthetics, I think this script is below average. The player shots are more-or-less impossible to notice at first, Sona's spell background helps bullets blend in during the first spell, items render above bullets and the STG Frame is very plain. 1.5/4.
======================================================================================================================
 
I think the addition of nonspells is a good touch and definitely better than nothing. The spells improved to become much more interesting than the originals as well. I think this is a pretty big improvement, all things considered. 4.5/6.
 
OVERALL SCORE: 5.92 + 1.5 + 4.5 = 11.92/20
