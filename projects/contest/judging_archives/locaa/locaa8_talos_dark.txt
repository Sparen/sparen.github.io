-Danmaku- (15 point)

Non-spell 1 :
Very solid pattern. Those circle things seem weird at first, but hell they works! Very fun to dodge. :) [8.5/10]

Spell 1 :
The circle-curvy bullets are something I don't like, but in this pattern they're tolerable. The main pattern is good even though they're not something special [12.5/15]

Non-spell 2 :
It's a multiple phases pattern ~ . Every pattern works together perfectly. I approve. :) [9/10]

Spell 2 :
It's...epic.
Seem hard at first, but when I realized I don't really have to worry about the lasers because the gap is always under the player, this pattern become a lot more easier. It's still fun though because of a good use of arrow bullets and bubbles. [13.5/15]

Spell 3 :
The aimed laser is a little bit of disappointing because it's so easy to dodge, but the shiny lasers at the end of each wave make up for it. Overall, it's a nice pattern. [13/15]
 
Danmaku Score = (15/65)*(8.5+12.5+9+13.5+13) = 13.04
 
-Visual- (2 point)
The stage background at the start of the script is absolutely stunning, too bad it's not used for the rest of fight. :|
The visual effect (some sort of light-ray?) look distracting at first, but then I realized it help me keep track of the Alice's position (since there's no enemy marker) They also represent the elements of the spell and make pattern look a lot more epic. :D
[1.75/2]

-Music- (1 point)
Good choice of music. Somehow it sounds really charming for me.
[1/1]
 
-Difficulty- (1 point)
At first I thought this was going to be super hard script (because a lot of people who did pc-98 script tend to do that), then it turned out to be fair and fun script. Nice work!
[0.75/1]
 
-Others- (1 point)
I love the wide screen ~ .It's pretty suitable choice for this fight, too.
[0.5/1]
 
Total Score : 13.04+1.75+1+0.75+0.5 = 17.04
