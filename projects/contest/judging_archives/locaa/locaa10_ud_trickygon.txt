In general, a very good script, as expected! The best part, in my opinion, were the Nonspells, which were all incredibly fun and enjoyable!

-I love the way the pattern unfolds, and the way it looks random but isn't. Bullets coming from all directions is always a fantastic thing. Plus, the colours are great.

-A concept used often, but it's used nicely here. I like the walls and the way the patterns of the 'flowers' change instead of being constant.

-Another fun nonspell, though the lines of bullets going front and back from the flowers is kind of weird looking? It functions pretty well, though!

-I really love how this spell looks, and the randomness of the arrow 'trails' is looks really good.

-The random angles of the explosions makes for a fun dodging experience! However, the lasers feel kind of tacked on, and feel almost tacky.

-My favourite spell in the bunch. The dragging gimmick, and just the general appearance of the different patterns is REALLY good. I love the light blue wave the most. It looks fantastic and plays great as well.

-My favourite of the nonspells, having tons of layers, and the square part is fun to dodge!

-Probably my least favourite spell. Partially because I'm pretty sure I've seen it before in one of your old Sakuya scripts. The knife spam is kind of 'eh', and doesn't really look all that great, either. It's not bad, just mediocre.
