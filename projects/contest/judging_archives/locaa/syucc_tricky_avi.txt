Unconnected Card Captors - Avi
For this contest I'm using a 25 point rating scale because I feel like it.
 
Danmaku Quality: 15/25
 
Danmaku Quality encompasses the quality of the danmaku in your script. "Good" patterns will equal a "good" score in this category. What makes a pattern good is subjective, but the #1 factor is fun. A flashy, gorgeous pattern that isn't fun won't fare well here. Note that aesthetic factors can still factor into this - proper usage of sound effects and graphics can make an unfair pattern fair, and improper usage of those can make an otherwise-fair pattern unfair.

To be more clear, an "average" pattern is a 5. You can gain or lose points and I'll probably tell you why.
 
Individual patterns will be rated out of 10. The average of that will be taken and scaled to calculate the Danmaku Quality score.
 
Aesthetics: 5/25
 
This category encompasses how your entry looks (and sounds). While danmaku should absolutely come first, visual and audio elements are also a part of the gameplay experience.
 
Adherence to Contest Theme: 5/25
 
5 points will be dedicated to how well the chosen character uses danmaku themes from other characters. A high score in this category means you did a good job of synthesizing the danmaku style of two characters, while a low score means that your synthesis was lacking.
======================================================================================================================

Nonspell 1: This pattern is fine. Not super impressive but not offensive either. This one dies SUPER fast. 4.75/10.

Nonspell 2: Now this seems like Mike for sure. Maybe a little bit better than the first non by virtue of lasting more than two seconds. 5.25/10.

Spell 1: I like this one a good bit more - it keeps you moving and I think it follows both character themes well enough. 6/10.

Nonspell 3: It seems like the amulet hitboxes are bigger than the graphic. Otherwise this seems like Mokou pretty solidly. 6/10.

Spell 2: I think the phoenix hitboxes are too small. The pattern is perfectly fine though - avoid the oversized amulet hitboxes while dealing with the randomish rice bullets. Not bad. 5.5/10.

Danmaku Score: 5.5/10 (scaled to 6.88/15)
======================================================================================================================
 
Aesthetically this script isn't too bad. The visuals are fine, if a bit plain. The complete lack of sound effects is a bit jarring. 2/5.
======================================================================================================================
 
In terms of following the contest gimmick, you do a pretty decent job. The inspirations are obvious and still feel Sumireko enough. 2.5/5.
 
OVERALL SCORE 6.88 + 2 + 2.5 = 11.38/25
