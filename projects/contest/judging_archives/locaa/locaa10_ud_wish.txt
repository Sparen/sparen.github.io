Decent work that was marred by beginner mistakes. A big thing missing was that the patterns looked very generic or uninteresting more often than not.

-A random card attack. Nothing too special otherwise.

-A simple but effective card. Nothing special, but fun to dodge.

-A very fun to dodge attack at first, but it gets very very cluttered and hard to read properly.

-Difficult. It's hard to dodge the unfreezing bullets and the laser at the same time. Second wave wasn't very fun, either.

-A very simple attack, but an enjoyable one, at least. The aimed wave lasts a while, it would have been better served to last shorter and come faster.

-Maziodyne has a massive gaping safespot on the right side of the screen, no lightning falls there.

-Not a very interesting or fun card, just lots of fast spinning.

-Hugging the bottom left corner of the screen erases the familiars without them shooting bullets, and if you try and do it legit, it gets incredibly overwhelming and nearly
impossible to dodge the walls and lasers.

-Philosopher's Stone -Lite-, the basic amulet pattern was fun to dodge. The other elements just made tons and tons of useless clutter.
