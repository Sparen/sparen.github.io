Unconnected Card Captors - Lushie
For this contest I'm using a 25 point rating scale because I feel like it.
 
Danmaku Quality: 15/25
 
Danmaku Quality encompasses the quality of the danmaku in your script. "Good" patterns will equal a "good" score in this category. What makes a pattern good is subjective, but the #1 factor is fun. A flashy, gorgeous pattern that isn't fun won't fare well here. Note that aesthetic factors can still factor into this - proper usage of sound effects and graphics can make an unfair pattern fair, and improper usage of those can make an otherwise-fair pattern unfair.

To be more clear, an "average" pattern is a 5. You can gain or lose points and I'll probably tell you why.
 
Individual patterns will be rated out of 10. The average of that will be taken and scaled to calculate the Danmaku Quality score.
 
Aesthetics: 5/25
 
This category encompasses how your entry looks (and sounds). While danmaku should absolutely come first, visual and audio elements are also a part of the gameplay experience.
 
Adherence to Contest Theme: 5/25
 
5 points will be dedicated to how well the chosen character uses danmaku themes from other characters. A high score in this category means you did a good job of synthesizing the danmaku style of two characters, while a low score means that your synthesis was lacking.

Nonspell 1: This one is pretty good! Spirals like Kogasa, but with Seija's gimmick incorporated. 8/10.

Spell 1: I still hate control inversion, but it's part of the gimmick so your soul is spared. Decent enough mix of both character themes and the pattern is fun enough. 7/10.

Nonspell 2: I like this one quite a lot as well. Fun mix of both themes; simple and effective. 8.5/10.

Spell 2: Grudge Bow from the bottom is actually pretty neat. Not the most original, but I had fun. 7.5/10.

Nonspell 3: Choosing an Okina-style pattern after the previous spell is actually quite neat. Good. 8/10.

Spell 3: Hi Kuroji. Actually quite fun and it's not too hard to remember where the brain fingerprint thingies will be. 7.75/10.

Spell 4: Pretty good pattern. I initially forgot I had the back shots available; if I remembered I would likely have taken a lot less time. Also very solid, 8/10. 

Danmaku Score: 7.82/10 (scaled to 11.73/15)
======================================================================================================================
 
Aesthetically this script is above average. Nothing super fancy, nothing bad. 3.25/5.
======================================================================================================================
 
This script does a very good job of following the contest gimmick. The patterns always felt like Seija with a mix of the involved character's danmaku style. 4.5/5.
 
OVERALL SCORE 11.73 + 3.25 + 4.5 = 19.48/25
