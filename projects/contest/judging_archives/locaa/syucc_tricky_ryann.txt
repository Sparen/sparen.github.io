Unconnected Card Captors - Ryann1908
For this contest I'm using a 25 point rating scale because I feel like it.
 
Danmaku Quality: 15/25
 
Danmaku Quality encompasses the quality of the danmaku in your script. "Good" patterns will equal a "good" score in this category. What makes a pattern good is subjective, but the #1 factor is fun. A flashy, gorgeous pattern that isn't fun won't fare well here. Note that aesthetic factors can still factor into this - proper usage of sound effects and graphics can make an unfair pattern fair, and improper usage of those can make an otherwise-fair pattern unfair.

To be more clear, an "average" pattern is a 5. You can gain or lose points and I'll probably tell you why.
 
Individual patterns will be rated out of 10. The average of that will be taken and scaled to calculate the Danmaku Quality score.
 
Aesthetics: 5/25
 
This category encompasses how your entry looks (and sounds). While danmaku should absolutely come first, visual and audio elements are also a part of the gameplay experience.
 
Adherence to Contest Theme: 5/25
 
5 points will be dedicated to how well the chosen character uses danmaku themes from other characters. A high score in this category means you did a good job of synthesizing the danmaku style of two characters, while a low score means that your synthesis was lacking.

I played everything not intended to freeze a single bullet or bomb because apparently that gives a bad end :(

Stage Pre-Misaki: Interesting enough. Literally everything? is aimed but that's not bad. 7.25/10.

Midboss Nonspell 1: Fairly interesting idea actually. I liked it. 7.5/10.

Midboss Spell 1: Actually fairly fun once you learn it. You need to aggressively dodge through gaps. 7.5/10.

Midboss Spell 2: Multi-phase, hmm. The best pattern so far, I'd say. 8.5/10.

Stage Post-Misaki: The parts that force you up and towards the middle are pretty interesting. B o w a p. 7.5/10.

hi Ichirin

Nonspell 1: This non really keeps you moving - it puts you under stress but it's not actually that difficult. Very nice. 8.5/10.

Spell 1: The screen shaking is thematic but I'd still suggest toning it down a notch because it's annoying. I like the idea of it though, and the pattern is fair once you get over the constant earthquake. 7/10.

Nonspell 2: This doesn't feel very strongly like Ichirin, but the pattern itself is quite fine. 7/10.

Spell 2: Thematically neat, but in practice you just dodge the rings. Which is fine, of course! 7.25/10.

Nonspell 3: Fun pattern, but it still doesn't feel very Ichirin. 7.75/10.

Spell 3: Lightning laser hitboxes are always annoying. Besides that I appreciate the multiple phases of this pattern. It's fun and fair enough. 7.5/10.

Nonspell 4: Another solid nonspell. 7.75/10.

Spell 4: Screenflipping is suffering, even if you attach fisting to it. My hatred of the gimmick aside this pattern isn't TOO bad to handle. 6.75/10.

Nonspell 5: S o l i d. Again, feels more like a pure Suika thing than Ichirin - attaching fisting does not an Ichirin make. 7.5/10.

Spell 5: What the hell is this. It's fascinating and novel, that's for sure. Making tiny bullets even tinier in a small window isn't something I like, but this is cool! 7.5/10.

Spell 6: wow fisting survival aaaand what the hell. I'll...judge the existing pattern and say it's fine? A bit harder than everything else, I'd say. 6.75/10.

Danmaku Score: 7.47/10 (scaled to 11.20/15)
======================================================================================================================
 
Aesthetically this script is pretty neat. Maybe that's just how LuaSTG be, but I'm quite impressed. 3.75/5.
======================================================================================================================
 
This script does a decent job of following the contest gimmick. I think you leaned too far into the characters that aren't Ichirin, especially in the nonspells. 3/5.
 
OVERALL SCORE 11.20 + 3.75 + 3 = 17.95/25
