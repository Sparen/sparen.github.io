-Danmaku- (15 point)
 
Non-spell 1 :
A bit of randomness but the dodging is fun. I kinda like it. [7.5/10]

Test Sign "Standard Danmaku Barrier"
What a simple name. xD
I like the lasers, arrows and mini-curving bullets (basically everything :D ), but nothing is outstanding. Overall, neat spellcard.[12/15]

Non-spell 2 :
The walls are pretty brutal that I decided to stay away from them completely. (or this is actually the right thing to do?) The danmaku after that is nice. [8/10]

Time Sign "Timeline Cross Incidient"
I actually like this a lot, especially the dots that come after the lasers. The flow is very good. I enjoy dodging this spellcard until the end. [13/15]

Non-spell 3 :
Very fun non-spell. I like the walls. They're done properly. The extra bullets are good,too. [9/10]

The Sailor of Time Encountering Herself"
Cool. I like how you did with the effect. The patterns are simple but the boss movement make up for it. Again, you did well with the flow of pattern. [12.5/15]

Danmaku Score =  (15/75)*(7.5+12+8+13+9+12.5) = 12.4

-Visual- (2 point)
I actually not fond of pc-98 graphic but this one is an exception. You made it look like a pc-98 script, while doing a cool effect here and there (such as the flashy effect that Chiyuri keep doing) . I also quite like the background. Good work.
[1.5/2]
 
-Music- (1 point)
Cute and catchy.
[0.75/1]
 
-Difficulty- (1 point)
Not much difference between easy, normal, and hard, but each of them is good and nothing too cheap.
[0.75/1]
 
-Others- (1 point)
Dialogue is short but at least it's something.
The pc-98 style was done perfectly, so this is a big plus.
[0.75/1]
 
Total Score : 12.4+1.5+0.75+0.75+0.75 = 16.15
