LOCAA 8 Judgment - RickyRister
 
All judgments by me will follow the following rubric:
Danmaku Quality*: 14/20
Character Relevance & Creativity: 3/20
Aesthetics: 3/20
This is a change since last time - danmaku matters more. Because in my opinion it should.
*All patterns are given a score out of 10. Then the average of that is multiplied by 1.4 to get the score out of 14.
~~~
Nonspell 1: The abrupt curving is misleading and makes this pattern far wonkier than it needs to be. 5/10.
 
Spell 1: Everything is really bright - consider dimming the background if you're going to use so many ADD bullets. Otherwise the pattern is acceptable. Pretty nondescript and boring. 5/10.
 
Nonspell 2: Actually pretty neat. I like this. 7/10.
 
Spell 2: I can't say I like the fact that it freezes the game occasionally. Pattern-wise, dodging a quite simple spiral with lasers and familiars to restrict your movement isn't really all that hard. It's fine. 6/10.
 
Nonspell 3: Also pretty neat. The tail end of each wave is different but not super challenging, which is good. Nice job. 7/10.

Spell 3: Quite the odd pattern. I just stayed under her and didn't really have to move except for certain waves. Patterns like this are quite hard to judge, but I don't really like this one very much. Depending on where you are it's either effortless or rather difficult. 5/10.

Nonspell 4: I think the red bullets are so slow that they're almost irrelevant. Could stand to make them faster. Otherwise I like this too. 6.5/10.

Spell 4: Rather short generic spiral patterns. ADD bullets + shiny stuff in the background (heck, even the spell circle thing gets in the way) = problems, be careful with that. 5/10.

Spell 5: Rather long survival spell, but it's really boring in my opinion. Lots of really slow streaming while dodging randomly shot blobs. The scare at the end is amusing, but otherwise I don't like this very much. 5/10.

Spell 6: The second phase REALLY should happen earlier - half of the lifebar is spent on rather boring curvy rings. Otherwise, it's really samey all the way through. Despite this, it's still a fair and simple challenge. 6/10.   
 
Danmaku Quality: (5 + 5 + 7 + 6 + 7 + 5 + 6.5 + 5 + 5 + 6)/ 10 = 5.75*1.4 = 8.05
 
The patterns don't really feel all that Kaguya - she does use rainbows, but surely there could be a tad more than that? There's some creativity here and there but a lot of patterns are also rather plain too. 1/3. 
 
Aesthetics: ADD bullets + shiny background = problems, as I said. That's a major glaring flaw. Otherwise nothing really looks super ugly graphically, except for maybe the rainbow blobs in the survival card. 1.25/3.
 
Final Score: 8.05 + 1 + 1.25 = 10.3
