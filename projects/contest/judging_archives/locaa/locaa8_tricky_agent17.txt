LOCAA 8 Judgment - Agent76...er, 17.
 
All judgments by me will follow the following rubric:
Danmaku Quality*: 14/20
Character Relevance & Creativity: 3/20
Aesthetics: 3/20
This is a change since last time - danmaku matters more. Because in my opinion it should.
*All patterns are given a score out of 10. Then the average of that is multiplied by 1.4 to get the score out of 14.
~~~
Nonspell 1: Not bad. Maybe a tad long of a lifebar but I enjoyed it. 7/10.
 
Spell 1: Also not bad. Can feel a bit overwhelming at times but I captured it all the same. Feels rather hard compared to the rest of the attacks. 6.5/10.
 
Nonspell 2: Also enjoyable. Very small spaces, but very slow. Good deisgn. 7/10.
 
Spell 2: Neat idea. Follow her or die horribly. Fun, fair, etc. 7.5/10.
 
Spell 3: Actually pretty boring. The lasers simply aren't threatening enough, and by the time they ARE a threat the pattern is basically over. The pattern itself is also a pretty boring spiral in my opinion. Not all that fun. 5/10.  
 
Danmaku Quality: (7 + 6.5 + 7 + 7.5 + 5)/ 5 = 6.6*1.4 = 9.24
 
The patterns feel Sanae appropriate and are fairly creative. Good job. 3/3.
 
Aesthetics: Pretty good aesthetically. Quite pretty, and the nametag at the opening is a great touch. 2.5/3.
 
Final Score: 9.24 + 3 + 2.5 = 14.74/20
