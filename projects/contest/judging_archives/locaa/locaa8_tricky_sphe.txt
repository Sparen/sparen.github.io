LOCAA 8 Judgment - Sphe
 
All judgments by me will follow the following rubric:
Danmaku Quality*: 14/20
Character Relevance & Creativity: 3/20
Aesthetics: 3/20
This is a change since last time - danmaku matters more. Because in my opinion it should.
*All patterns are given a score out of 10. Then the average of that is multiplied by 1.4 to get the score out of 14.

Stage Pre-Midboss: I can't say I like all the fairies dying near instantly or the big fairies doing nothing, but the patterns are fairly interesting despite this. 6/10.

Midboss Nonspell: Fine, fine. A bit typical in my opinion but it's still fine. 6.5/10.

Midboss Spell: ...a VERY extreme streaming spell. Once you get the hang of it it's doable, but at first it's very overwhelming. The pattern that Alice shoots is rather plain as well. Not my favorite attack. 5.5/10.

And then Shinki shows up. Gasp.

Nonspell 1: Pretty good. I don't think using bullets of a similar color to the background is wise here, though. 6/10.
 
Spell 1: Neat idea. I think the white bullets are kinda tacked-on to the pattern but it's fine. 6.5/10.
 
Nonspell 2: Great! I like this quite a bit. 8/10.
 
Spell 2: I think the time between the lasers appearing and them spawning bullets is way too low. Combine that with blue lasers that are barely visible on the background, and you get something that is a neat idea but is simply too difficult and/or cheap to work. The last phases are much more fair, but don't do much to redeem this in my eyes. 4.5/10.

Spell 3: This pattern would be awesome if it weren't for the too fast lasers returning from the last card. The helix-esque wall is a more tame version of that, if a bit hard to dodge on reaction still. The rest of the pattern is very solid, but it just gets unfair when combined with the lasers and the helix. 6/10.
 
Danmaku Quality: 6 + 6.5 + 5.5 + 6 + 6.5 + 8 + 4.5 + 6)/ 9 = 6.125*1.4 = 8.575
 
As for character relevance and creativity, the patterns feel like Shinki and they're quite creative. Nice job. Alice is a bit uninspired though. 2.5/3.
 
Aesthetics: Spectacular! 3/3.
 
Final Score: 8.575 + 2.5 + 3 = 14.075
