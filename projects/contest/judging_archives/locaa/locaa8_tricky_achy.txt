LOCAA 8 Judgment - Achy

All judgments by me will follow the following rubric:
Danmaku Quality*: 14/20
Character Relevance & Creativity: 3/20
Aesthetics: 3/20
This is a change since last time - danmaku matters more. Because in my opinion it should.
*All patterns are given a score out of 10. Then the average of that is multiplied by 1.4 to get the score out of 14.

Played on Normal mode!

Nonspell 1: Reasonable challenge while being fair. Good. 7/10. 

Spell 1: Sorta reminds me of Selaginella 9. Also fair, not all that exciting though. 6/10.

Nonspell 2: Pretty good idea! I think it drags on for a bit long, but otherwise very solid. 7.5/10.

Spell 2: Would probably be better if you rendered the "dragon" bullets below the other ones. Another solid idea, but its execution could be better in this instance. 5.5/10.

Spell 3: I don't think such a gimmick is very apparent, or something you should combine with micrododging. This might be better if you outright forbid movement in one direction and allowed normal movement in the other. 5/10.

Spell 4: Pretty decent way to end the script. I didn't find it that hard, but it fits her fairly well and I like the use of gravity bullets. 6.5/10.

Danmaku Quality: (7 + 6 + 7.5 + 5.5 + 5 + 6.5)/6 = 6.25*1.4 = 8.75/14.
 
As for character relevance, all of the attacks feel character appropriate. The patterns ARE pretty creative too. 3/3.
 
Aesthetics: I think the nonspell background could stand to not be a rainbow, but it doesn't get in the way particularly much so eh. All around fine. You probably should've upped the volume of sounds and music - they're very quiet compared to other scripts (and even most player scripts). 2/3.
 
Final Score: 8.75 + 3 + 2 = 13.75.
