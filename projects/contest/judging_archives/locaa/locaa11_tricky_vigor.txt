LOCAA 11 - Vigor
 
All judgments by me will be out of 20 points, using the following categories.
 
Danmaku Quality: 10/20
 
Danmaku Quality encompasses the quality of the danmaku in your script. Good patterns will equal a good score in this category. Note that aesthetic factors can still factor into this - proper usage of sound effects and graphics can make an unfair pattern fair and make an otherwise-fair pattern unfair. Fairness is a pretty big factor here.
 
Individual patterns will be rated out of 10, and the average of that will be taken.
 
Creativity/Use of Perfect Possession: 7/20
 
Since the Perfect Possession gimmick is central to this contest, how well you use it is a major part of your score. The more creative and the less forced it feels, the better.
 
Aesthetics: 3/20
 
This category encompasses how your entry looks (and sounds). While danmaku should come first, other elements like graphics and sounds are also an important part of the gameplay experience.
 
Played on Hard Mode.

DANMAKU QUALITY
=======================================================================================================================================
Nonspell 1: Pretty. Besides being pretty it's also a good pattern, if a bit easy for the Hard difficulty. 7.75/10.
 
Spell 1: I think the fact that everything is so red is a bad thing in this card, since you've got a lot of somewhat-glowy red things to dodge. The small bullets also go pretty fast while overlapping with the next wave of knives. It's neat, but could be fairer. 6/10.
 
Nonspell 2: It's a bit frightening to have that line of bullets go up into you until you realize that it doesn't hurt if you're low enough on the screen. Otherwise, I think this nonspell is great. 8/10.
 
Spell 2: An interesting take on LÃ¦vateinn that isn't quite as memorization heavy. It took me a while to think to bait Flandre higher up on the screen, but once that was settled I thought it was a decently fun spellcard. As an aside, it's a bit worrying how you can bring this to about 2/3 health before a single bullet is fired. 7/10.

Average Danmaku Quality: 7.19

CREATIVITY/PERFECT POSSESSION
=======================================================================================================================================
 
I think it's pretty creative and Perfect Possession gets enough usage. 6/7
 
=======================================================================================================================================
AESTHETICS
=======================================================================================================================================
 
Aesthetically pleasing, though the shininess does become a hindrance at times. 2.5/3.
