So much speed, so many walls...

-Giant walls with tiny bullets inside them. Almost Subterranean Rose esque. It would be easier and more manageable without the tiny blue stars going the opposite of the walls.

-The tiny blue stars come out WAY too fast and in way too tight of configurations. The big stars as well, except they have odd hitboxes that are difficult to read and are, again, BIG.

-I don't get the purpose of the fog, and again, I don't like the big star walls.

-I really hate dodging the fire in this spell, as it comes up fast and falls faster. The purple bullets feel like an almost seperate pattern, too, so it feels slightly disjointed.

-IF, RANDOMLY, AT ANY GIVEN POINT, THE PLAYER MUST BE EXPECTED TO DODGE UP AND AROUND THE BOSS TO SURVIVE, RETHINK YOUR ENTIRE PATTERN. SERIOUSLY. The fact that there's a random choice of the spinning walls, the random stars, or the SOLID WALLS is stupid, because you can't be prepared to dodge all three, as they all have different ways you're expected to dodge.
With a gimmick like this, 'random choice of pattern' is going to be WAY too frustrating.
