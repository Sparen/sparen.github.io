UCC Judging - 東方青熺伝　～ the Lazuline Fulguration of Effervescence
 
Pattern judging:
 
--Stage Portion 1--
"ah yes lethal passageway" (7/10)
-A fine stage portion, No pattern overstays it's welcome or is too hard or boring.
-My only criticism is midportion dialogue while also being attacked by red yin yang orbs, but it's a relatively minor one.
 
--Misaki Non--
"oh no an oc" (5/10)
-This pattern is interesting, it is rather uninteresting but these amulet walls may be a little too tight for comfort.
-That's uhh, it really, It's not bad.

--Misaki Spell 1-- Trail Taint "Obscure Obsession"
"THE ROTATIONING BEGINS (7/10)
-The way she moves may catch some people off guard at first glance, there's a slight possibility for cheap shots.
-However, outside of this, This pattern ain't that bad, The concept is really nice, not having the player be comfortable in a single spot in order to damage the boss.

--Misaki Spell 2-- Focal Point "Transmogrification Light"
"insert funny joke here i ain't got any" (8/10)
-This is a very varied spell, One that flows quite well and is quite fun to dodge.
-It can get a little tight at the end when it starts looping blue orbs with amulets but when that point is reached the boss is already quite dead.
-Nice spell, No many criticisms here.
 
--Stage Portion 2--
"-1 point for the BoWaP" (8/10)
-Another quite solid stage portion!
-I found a safespot down on the bottom of the screen in the middle when the multicolored arrowhead balls fly around, at that point they can't touch you at all.
-I don't particularly agree with the BoWaP death fairy, but there's really nothing wrong with it.
 
--Ichirin Non 1--
"lazors, ahoy" (4/10)
-Aimed lasers with Icicle shots.
-A very simple pattern, Fits Ichirin well, But isn't this a Ichirin card?
-This means the pattern itself is not really following the spirit of the contest itself?
 
--Ichirin Spell 1-- Barrage "Heavenly Ramparton Peril"
"punch ze wall oh yeaahhh" (5/10)
-I enjoy the concept of this spell, But I think the tiny unzan fists are too punyyyy.
-The aimed "Wall" homes in a little after is fired, which causes a bit of weirdness in aiming, and the pellets may be a little bit too random.
-Also, this is another self-spell.
 
--Ichirin Non 2--
"kero, but may be too much kero" (5/10)
-I mean... yeah, This is Suwako alright.
-But perhaps, too much Suwako? I am personally unsure about this one since the judging rules say score is based on how much of a likeness is in the pattern, but there isn't any Ichirin here.
-Not even the bigger amulet walls save it here, apologies.
 
--Ichirin Spell 2-- Divine Punch "Moriya Ring Entanglement" 
"speeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeen" (4/10)
-This pattern is heavily made out of... rings?
-Either straight rings or crisscrossing rings, They're both relatively boring to dodge, but pretty nice to look at.
-And again, there's a lot of Suwako, but nearly not enough Ichirin, perhaps have the fists be solid and slower? Or perhaps bouncing.
 
--Ichirin Non 3--
"bataca" (4/10)
-As with the other two nons, Same thing applies here, A lot of Raiko, No ichirin.
-The third wave may be a little bit too tight, just a little.
 
--Ichirin Spell 3-- Taiko Punch "Lightning Fulmination" 
"actual blue lady show" (9/10)
-Now this is a very nice spell.
-It is incredibly varied and a single loop lasts almost half the timer.
-The hitboxes on the lightning lasers may be a little jank which stops the spell from being excellent.

--Ichirin Non 4--
"why does everyone insist in bringing in seija" (4/10)
-Mhm mhm, Another non that takes a lot of inspiration from their main recipient but none from the actual character.
-The seija non here is also a little bit static?
 
--Ichirin Spell 4-- Back Punch "Dismantling of Amanosagume Family" 
"screms in flip" (4/10)
-Ehhh?
-There's the flipping gimmick applied, but it's usage is mostly inconsequential.
-The first wave doesn't really need to be redirected, as Ichirin stops before she squishes you with arrows, and the only real place the gimmick comes into effect is the spiral, which is taken directly from Seija's final spell...

--Ichirin Non 5--
"punch, punch, it's all in the mind" (7/10)
-We getting into the more interesting stuff now.
-Ichirin punches ~~while too tiny~~ work really well as mini-suika replacements, as seen here.
-The only issue here is that it's very easily misdirected, which leaves dodging almost moot.

--Ichirin Spell 5-- "Miniature Sidestepping Strategy on Mt. Ooe's Everlasting Winter Storm" 
"i hate this spell because it stole one of my concepts" (10/10)
-Honestly? One of my favourite spells.
-The concept is amazing, I even thought about it is using in one of my own scripts.
-The pattern itself is very nice to dodge, and very pleasing to look at, It may be too fast, though, but that's relatively minor. ~also tiny fists~

--Ichirin Spell 6-- "Final Miserable Blow of the Nyuudou" 
"cardcaptor cirno" (6/10)
-A neat recreation of Shion's final final spell using fists.
-Bullets are random, but a pattern is there.
-Too bad the spell itself gets cut off due to PLOT.
 
--Closing Thoughts--
 
And interesting and well made script.
Aesthetic wise it was quite neat, everything holds together, nothing looks out of place.
The presence of an OC was quite jarring at first, since most of us are expecting official 2hu's.
When it comes to the boss, it is very hit or miss.
Ichirin's patterns can be really nice or be quite bland, the latter specially refers to the nonspells that take too much from a boss and nothing from her herself.
I don't have too much to say about the plot, I personally don't exactly jive with metaplot and out of game windows and such, but you do you.

Needless to say, a very solid script that I can see people liking a lot.
