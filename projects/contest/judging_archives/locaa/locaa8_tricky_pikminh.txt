LOCAA 8 Judgment - Pikwhoever's Clownpiece

All judgments by me will follow the following rubric:
Danmaku Quality*: 14/20
Character Relevance & Creativity: 3/20
Aesthetics: 3/20
This is a change since last time - danmaku matters more. Because in my opinion it should.
*All patterns are given a score out of 10. Then the average of that is multiplied by 1.4 to get the score out of 14.
~~~
Nonspell 1: The gaps between starts are...very, very unforgiving if the boss movement decides it hates you. Certainly like Junko, I guess? I don't like it all that much. 4/10.
 
Spell 1: Nothing special. A lot more forgiving than the previous pattern. 5/10.

Nonspell 2: More forgiving than the first nonspell but that thing CAN be pretty brutal. A bit plain. 5/10.

Spell 2: It's really slow to start (the lasers don't reach the player for aaaages) but when they do I guess it's a challenging card. The rings aren't all that much to dodge, and neither are the lasers. Fairly fun once it gets going, but by the time it gets going the card may as well be 3/4th of the way done. 5/10. 

Danmaku Quality: 4+5+5+5/4 = 4.75*1.4 = 6.65/14.

As for character relevance, the nonspells don't feel all the clownpiecey other than the giant lasers. The first spell is a tad plain but I suppose the second suits her. 1.75/3.

Aesthetics: Graphically the script is acceptable. Be careful with using bullets of a similar color to the background. The two lines of dialogue were pretty nice, I suppose. 1.5/3.

Final Score: 6.65 + 1.75 + 1.5 = 9.5.
