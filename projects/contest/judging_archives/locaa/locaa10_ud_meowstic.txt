-AstroTengu Comment-

I love this script so much. It's fun and cool to play and to watch, and the colours are so good, and AAAAH.

-Except for this attack. It's kind of just a bland Illusionary Dominance rip. Nice joke, at least.

-Dodging the red waves is fun and fast, and then you switch to the blue wave (KAMAITACHI!), which comes out so beautifully with that spin, and it's such a really cool pattern.

-Tengu Blade is a standard chasing attack, but it serves its purpose well, and it forces you to dodge back into the green waves.

-TORNADO HOLD, OH MY GOSH. The green bullets and how they move, and how you're forced to stream the red waves through them is so neat and cool! It's such a fantastic concept, and it looks so freaking good!

-A Marisa esque pattern. I wish the green star lines were aimed instead of random, but it's really cool either way.

-I do have some problems with this one, mostly in the sense that Astroman doesn't do much himself except the static blue rings, which don't really add or take away from the pattern much.

-MEGA FLARE +1!!! It's a really fast version of Utsuho's mega flare, and it's so much fun to dodge through them!

-I really like the combo here! The walls could be a bit bigger, but that's about it!

-I love how the colours all work together here, and Astroman's dark green bullets, with the tornado hold walls, and tenguman's red bullets, all look so good together and make for such a fun dodging experience!
