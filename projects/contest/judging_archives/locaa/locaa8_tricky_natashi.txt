LOCAA 8 Judgment - Natashi

All judgments by me will follow the following rubric:
Danmaku Quality*: 14/20
Character Relevance & Creativity: 3/20
Aesthetics: 3/20
This is a change since last time - danmaku matters more. Because in my opinion it should.
*All patterns are given a score out of 10. Then the average of that is multiplied by 1.4 to get the score out of 14.

Played on Normal mode!

Nonspell 1: Sorta spammy but reasonably spammy. 6/10. 

Spell 1: I think the phoenixes are much too unforgiving. 5/10.

Nonspell 2: Neat fireball patterns! 8/10.

Spell 2: Also a fine pattern. I think it can drag on for a bit long though, and I easily be made it into just streaming. 6/10.

Nonspell 3: Is a bit obnoxious if she makes a lot of vertical movements. I don't think the knives really need to be ADD rendered but it's not too annoying. 6/10.

Spell 3: A less bouncy take on Flaw of Forgiving Shrine. Gets a bit ludicrous depending on what wave you're on. 6/10.

Spell 4: Well, it's certainly a survival. The bullet spawning circles are a bit hard to notice at first and some of the patterns do feel outright cheap, though. 5/10.

Spell 5: The first wave of fireballs at the beginning makes you move downward, then fire suddenly shows up everywhere and kills you. Yay. Then you dodge aimed shots while also dodging rings and randomly spawning fireballs that seem to never go away. It's fairly boring and cheapshots you at the beginning - not very good. 4/10.

lol "do whatever you want to my body"

Danmaku Quality: (6 + 5 + 8 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 5 + 4)/8 = 5.75*1.4 = 8.05/14.
 
As for character relevance, seems Mokou enough to me. The patterns ARE pretty creative too. 2/3.
 
Aesthetics: I don't like the weird fake-high resolution thing you did. Bullets are the same size but the player is larger and moves faster. Micrododging becomes a chore and it just makes things feel weird. 1/3.
 
Final Score: 8.05 + 2 + 1 = 11.05.
