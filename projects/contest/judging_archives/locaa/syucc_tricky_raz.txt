Unconnected Card Captors - raz
For this contest I'm using a 25 point rating scale because I feel like it.
 
Danmaku Quality: 15/25
 
Danmaku Quality encompasses the quality of the danmaku in your script. "Good" patterns will equal a "good" score in this category. What makes a pattern good is subjective, but the #1 factor is fun. A flashy, gorgeous pattern that isn't fun won't fare well here. Note that aesthetic factors can still factor into this - proper usage of sound effects and graphics can make an unfair pattern fair, and improper usage of those can make an otherwise-fair pattern unfair.

To be more clear, an "average" pattern is a 5. You can gain or lose points and I'll probably tell you why.
 
Individual patterns will be rated out of 10. The average of that will be taken and scaled to calculate the Danmaku Quality score.
 
Aesthetics: 5/25
 
This category encompasses how your entry looks (and sounds). While danmaku should absolutely come first, visual and audio elements are also a part of the gameplay experience.
 
Adherence to Contest Theme: 5/25
 
5 points will be dedicated to how well the chosen character uses danmaku themes from other characters. A high score in this category means you did a good job of synthesizing the danmaku style of two characters, while a low score means that your synthesis was lacking.

Played on Contest Mode aka Normal.

Tsukasa Nonspell: It's a Tsukasa nonspell alright. Pretty good. 8/10.

Nonspell 1: Pretty good. Feels like a blend of Lily White and Marisa for sure. 8.5/10.

Spell 1: Very interesting pattern. I panicked a bit when tons of the flower familiar things showed up but it's actually not very hard. I like this very much. 9/10.

Nonspell 2: Sexybanki :0. I like this spin on her usual themes. 8.25/10.

Spell 2: Neat! Feels more stressful to dodge than it really is and I quite like the pattern. Maybe weak on the Sekibanki theme though. 8.75/10. 

Nonspell 3: I appreciate the literal dipper she has in this pattern. Very good as well. 8.75/10.

Spell 3: A very simple and effective mix of both Marisa and Murasa's usual gimmicks. Very, very nice. 10/10.

Spell 4: Very interesting idea for this one. The fact that shooting the familiar is possible/resets the pattern isn't made very clear, but other than that I quite like this pattern too. 8.5/10.

Danmaku Score: 8.72/10 (scaled to 13.08/15)
======================================================================================================================
 
Aesthetically this script is pretty neat. Using 3D models as sprites is a unique touch. The bullet designs are interesting too. 4/5.
======================================================================================================================
 
This script does a great job of following the gimmick. Patterns still feel Marisa-y while being a blend of other characters, though the Sekibanki spell doesn't feel too strongly like her. 3.75/5.
 
OVERALL SCORE 13.08 + 4 + 3.75 = 20.83/25
