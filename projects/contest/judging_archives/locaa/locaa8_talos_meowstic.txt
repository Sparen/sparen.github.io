-Danmaku- (15 point)
 
Non-spell 1 :
Pretty cool non-spell. My only complaint is blue amulets because they often wall me, but it's probably I'm really bad at avoiding them.
[8/10]

Nue Sign "Mysterious Non-bendy Snake Rain" :
Very nice spawn positions for lasers. The blue fireballs are also quite fun to do misdirecting. I love how you give them low velocity on start and use acceleration, so that the player has time to prepare. [13/15]

Non-spell 2 :
It's intimidating on the first try because of high velocity amulets. It's actually not bad. The red bullets gave me a weird feeling (though it's probably fit Nue character.) [7.5/10]

Unidentified "Rainbow UFO Invasion" :
The yellow pellets have nice angle. The fireballs are fun to dodge. The straight lasers are ok. I only have a problem with the blue lasers. They are kinda hard to see because of how thin they are, and with the background it's even worse. [12/15]

Non-spell 3 :
It's a strange pattern (but fit Nue perfectly). Dodging-wise it's solid I think. [8/10]

Contrast "Duality of Pure and Unpure" :
I like this. For the first part, the pattern is simply fun. You did a good job on movement of Nue and UFO. For the second part, the danmaku is very effective on how it did. It's simple and excellent on the same time. [13.5/15]

Survival Spell ???? (Sorry I can't see the name xD) :
What a great survival spellcard. It's has a nice design (the cloud thingy) with the right amount of bullet. I love the variety in it and the fact that you decided to use the non-wall pattern on the last 10 second, so that the player can dodge freely (in the limited amount of space) without having to worry about getting walled. [14/15]

Purified UFO of The Chimera" :
It's the final spellcard but I don't have much thing to say. I'm not particularly fond of the lasers in this pattern because they restricted player's movement too much. (and I don't find being restrictive is fun.) However, I like the last phase. Lasers are spawned rapidly in a short time so they don't restrict player and the amulets walls have appropriate starting positions.[11.5/15]
 
Danmaku Score = (15/105)*(8+13+7.5+12+8+13.5+14+11.5) = 12.5
 
-Visual- (2 point)
I like how you did with the stage background. The boss aura looks cool. Anything else is fine, I guess?
[1.25/2]
 
-Music- (1 point)
Cool remix. Fit the fight.
[0.75/1]
 
-Difficulty- (1 point)
While it's a bit hard, it's also balanced around hard, so it's not actually a bad thing. In fact, it's pretty nice. xD
[0.75/1]
 
-Others- (1 point)
Quality dialogue I must say.
[0.5/1]

 
Total Score : 12.5+1.25+0.75+0.75+0.5 = 15.75
