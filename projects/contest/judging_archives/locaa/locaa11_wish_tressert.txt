LoCaA 11 Judging by Wish

Each pattern is judged out of 20 points:
?/9 - Creativity of patterns + use of Perfect Possession
?/8 - Fun factor + pattern design: is the pattern fun to play through? does it have any glaring flaws?
?/3 - Adequate challenge: if a pattern is too difficult or too easy this may be detracted from.

Overall aesthetics and experience will count for the equivalent of 1 pattern's worth of points.
?/7.5 - Graphics: This includes backgrounds, HUD, and everything involved but the patterns themselves.
?/7.5 - Sound: Did you pick a good soundtrack for this script?  This includes both music and sound effects.
?/5 - Details: Did you include a custom HUD?  Did you include a nice menu? Were there things about the script that made it stick out that deserve a mention?
This score is detracted from when there is a bad experience, coding errors, or general laziness when it comes to details.

The score of all patterns (including the experience "pattern") is added up, and then converted to a score out of 20.  Up to two decimal places are used, and scores will be rounded up to the nearest hundredth.

Script: A Legacy of Malice
Creator: Tres
Difficulty Played: Easyish
Player Used: Junko

Pattern 1 (Nonspell 1):
	Creativity/Perfect Possession (4/9): Nice Alice attack.  No Marisa, and it's kinda standard, but I like it.
	Fun Factor/Pattern Design (6/8): Fun to dodge, not very difficult, but a good opener.
	Adequate Challenge (2.5/3): Easy but befitting to the difficulty title.  Thought this might be around Touhou's Normal difficulty.

Pattern 2 (Spell 1):
	Creativity/Perfect Possession (5/9): Not what I expected from an Alice spell, more direct.  No Marisa, but it's good. (Music syncing was a little weird here)
	Fun Factor/Pattern Design (5/8): The bursts of arrowheads really make you move, but they seem really long, almost too long.
	Adequate Challenge (2/3): Oddly harder than I expected.

Pattern 3 (Nonspell 2):
	Creativity/Perfect Possession (4.5/9): Marisa's solo nonspell.  Standard but good.
	Fun Factor/Pattern Design (3/8): Keep in mind I wasn't shooting at all during this script for the music syncing to "work", but maybe I should have because this attack seems really short.  I didn't notice anything wrong with it per se but it's over before I could have fun with it.
	Adequate Challenge (2.5/3): Looked fine, but not much reached me before the timer expired.

Pattern 4 (Spell 2):
	Creativity/Perfect Possession (7.5/9): Yes!  A spell where they interact!  I like how Marisa's setup of stars turned into an Alice-like pattern very naturally.  The pattern itself was simple, but good.
	Fun Factor/Pattern Design (7/8): Fun to dodge, fast-paced, very good.
	Adequate Challenge (3/3): It wasn't too hard.

Pattern 5 (Nonspell 3):
	Creativity/Perfect Possession (7/9): Good stuff here, Marisa familiars exploding, Alice chimes in with some danmaku of her own.  Again, simple but good.
	Fun Factor/Pattern Design (6/8): It was slower paced than the last one, so it wasn't *as* fun, but it was still good.
	Adequate Challenge (1.5/3): Not many of Marisa's stars reached me.

Pattern 6 (Spell 3):
	Creativity/Perfect Possession (8/9): The most inventive use of both character's attacks so far.  Alice's doll knives being extra obstacles for Master Spark works really well.
	Fun Factor/Pattern Design (7/8): Back to fast pace.  Master Spark fires fast, but that keeps me on my toes.
	Adequate Challenge (2.5/3): Easy but good.

Pattern 7 (Nonspell 4):
	Creativity/Perfect Possession (7.5/9): Using some new material here, I see!  GFW Marisa nonspell was a welcome addition, and Alice's other PCB nonspell was well used.
	Fun Factor/Pattern Design (6/8): Faster than everything else, but still fun!  Not as much reached me this time due to music syncing.
	Adequate Challenge (2.5/3): Harder than expected.

Pattern 8 (Spell 4):
	Creativity/Perfect Possession (9/9): This one blew me away.  There were a lot of parts to this one but every part had its place.
	Fun Factor/Pattern Design (8/8): The most fun attack to dodge as well. Something particularly cool about the design is how the last hexagon gets the player to move to where the next pattern is supposed to start.
	Adequate Challenge (2/3): Probably too much for an Easy difficulty.

Pattern 9 (Spell 5):
	Creativity/Perfect Possession (7.5/9): It was a good concept, but I think it overstayed its welcome just a bit.
	Fun Factor/Pattern Design (6/8): I didn't know I was going to be forced to shoot, but that's fine.  It was still fun to dodge.  The Marisa GFW balls weren't apparent at first as to what they would do, but once the player knows it's fine.
	Adequate Challenge (2.5/3): A little challenging for Easy.

Aesthetics and Experience:
	Graphics (5.5/7.5): Mostly very minimalistic in terms of effects but nothing stood out as bad.
	Sound (7/7.5): Sound design was important given the music syncing, and I'd say you did a good job.
	Details (5/5): The fact that this was made to be music synced didn't work out for every attack, but I like that the effort was made, especially with such a long script.

Overall Score: 152.5/200
Converted Score: 15.25/20

Comments:
It started off slow, but once it started moving into the more creative attacks it was really good!
The Barrage Musical gameplay caught me off guard because I wasn't sure when I was supposed to shoot and when I wasn't, but it showed a lot of thought and effort went into a lot of the attacks.
I feel like the music syncing was better at first when it was simpler patterns, but as the patterns became more creative, there was less effort put into the music sync (aside from the last two spells, those were really good)
Either way, great job Tres.
