Unconnected Card Captors - Wish
For this contest I'm using a 25 point rating scale because I feel like it.
 
Danmaku Quality: 15/25
 
Danmaku Quality encompasses the quality of the danmaku in your script. "Good" patterns will equal a "good" score in this category. What makes a pattern good is subjective, but the #1 factor is fun. A flashy, gorgeous pattern that isn't fun won't fare well here. Note that aesthetic factors can still factor into this - proper usage of sound effects and graphics can make an unfair pattern fair, and improper usage of those can make an otherwise-fair pattern unfair.

To be more clear, an "average" pattern is a 5. You can gain or lose points and I'll probably tell you why.
 
Individual patterns will be rated out of 10. The average of that will be taken and scaled to calculate the Danmaku Quality score.
 
Aesthetics: 5/25
 
This category encompasses how your entry looks (and sounds). While danmaku should absolutely come first, visual and audio elements are also a part of the gameplay experience.
 
Adherence to Contest Theme: 5/25
 
5 points will be dedicated to how well the chosen character uses danmaku themes from other characters. A high score in this category means you did a good job of synthesizing the danmaku style of two characters, while a low score means that your synthesis was lacking.

Played on Morally Grey mode.

Stage Segments Prior to Murasa: Impressive amounts of music syncing! The need to keep streaming for the ENTIRE stage is interesting. Maybe overwhelming for someone who only plays Touhou, but it's neat. 8.75/10.

Murasa Nonspell: This was quite fun to dodge and not too long. I like it. 8.5/10.

Stage Segment After Murasa: Second verse, same as the first. 8.75/10.

Shou Nonspell: c u r v y l a s e r. Not bullshit, thankfully, but quite short. 7.75/10.

Shou Spell: I quite like this pattern. Slow enough to be fair, and how the lasers spread is nice to look at. 8.5/10.

I've already given two stage segment scores and the next is so short that I won't judge it oop.

Nonspell 1: This non is neat - the laser making you move a ton is kind of annoying, but it doesn't take TOO long. 8.5/10.

Spell 1: Interesting pattern. Drags on a little bit but it's interesting enough to dodge? I like how you can stream into the spot without any lasers or between two lasers fairly effortlessly. 7.75/10.

Nonspell 2: Mirans- I mean Tsukasa non + Byakuren lasers. Pretty good. 8.25/10.

Spell 2: Keeps you on your toes, and thankfully there is a delay cloud for those lasers that come from the sun thingies. 8.25/10. 

Nonspell 3: Oh no it's scarlet bullshit. I think it's appropriate considering Byakuren has a similar non herself. The spread shot part seems a bit too random for my liking, but it's fun regardless. 8.25/10.

Spell 3: Quite good too. I think the difficulty is a bit too high, or maybe I'm very bad at handling the waves where the bubbles and amulets overlap. Appealing way to end the script regardless. 8.5/10.

Danmaku Score: 8.34/10 (scaled to 12.51/15)
======================================================================================================================
 
Aesthetically this script is pretty neat. Music syncing is a pretty strong aesthetic factor and even things like Byakuren's "fireworks" when she appears add quite a bit to the script. 4/5.
======================================================================================================================
 
This script does a great job of following the gimmick. There's a strong influence of other characters in her patterns. 4/5.
 
OVERALL SCORE 12.51 + 4 + 4 = 20.51/25
