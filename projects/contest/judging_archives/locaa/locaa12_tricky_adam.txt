LOCAA 12 - Adam
 
For this contest I'll continue using a 20-point rating system. Points will be divided as follows:
 
Danmaku Quality: 10/20
 
Danmaku Quality encompasses the quality of the danmaku in your script. "Good" patterns will equal a "good" score in this category. What makes a pattern good is subjective, but the #1 factor is fun. A flashy, gorgeous pattern that isn't fun won't fare well here. Note that aesthetic factors can still factor into this - proper usage of sound effects and graphics can make an unfair pattern fair, and improper usage of those can make an otherwise-fair pattern unfair.
 
Individual patterns will be rated out of 10. The average of that will be taken to calculate the Danmaku Quality score.
 
Aesthetics: 4/20
 
This category encompasses how your entry looks (and sounds). While danmaku should absolutely come first, visual and audio elements are also a part of the gameplay experience.
 
Measure of Improvement: 6/20
 
6 points will be dedicated to how much you improved. This is entirely subjective, of course, but I'll comment about why I gave you the score that you received.
======================================================================================================================

Since this has difficulties I judged ~~Hard~~ Keter Mode yaaaay.

Nonspell 1: A great start. I thought the sounds increasing in pitch was a good touch. 8.5/10.
 
Spell 1: I think this is a good pattern. It's still simple to dodge, but it keeps you on your toes. 8/10.
 
Nonspell 2: I like this a little bit less than the previous nonspell, but that doesn't mean it isn't good! 8.25/10.
 
Spell 2: Weird bendy-knives are weird. I'd personally prefer putting the kunai above the knives, but it didn't pose TOO much of a problem for me. 7.25/10.

Nonspell 3: Neat boss aura, neat pattern. 8.25/10.

Spell 3: I thought this one was a little easy compared to the previous attacks, but maybe it's just me. Besides that I think it's a good pattern too. 8/10.

Nonspell 4: Consistently good, much like the other nonspells. 8.25/10.

Spell 4: I like it. I...admittedly don't have much to say at this point. Consistent high quality seems to be the theme of this script. 8/10.

Spell 5: Much more of a challenge than the other attacks, which I think is fitting for a final spell. All-around fun and a great way to end the script. 8.5/10.
 
Danmaku Average: 8.11/10
======================================================================================================================
 
In terms of aesthetics, I think this script is very good. The minor touches like the musical notes changing in pitch are neat, bullet don't commit any Blendcrimes:tm:, visuals are nice (that sprite has a lot of frame sof animation). Everything works together to make a pleasing script. 3.5/4.
======================================================================================================================
 
The improvement score is a bit hard to calculate. The new script is definitely better than the old one, but I wouldn't say it's that dramatic of an increase all things considered, as the old script isn't really that bad. You did keep the idea behind many attacks and improve on them, though. I think a fair score for this category is a 4.25/6.
 
OVERALL SCORE: 8.11 + 3.5 + 4.25 = 15.86/20
