-Danmaku- (15 point)
 
Non-spell 1 :
Typicall Ringo non-spell. Nothing to say here. [7.5/10]

Pure Rabbit "Blueberry Dango"
I like this. The pattern is both fun to dodge and fair. The effect is nice, too [13/15]

Non-spell 2 :
Now this is something Zun doesn't do before. I like the transition between blue wave and red wave. Very appealing. :) [8.5/10]

Pure Rabbit "Anko Dango"
It's really a dango. xD
The 1st phase is nice. The 2nd phase is the easiest but I like the most. The 3rd phase is fun (I like stream). All in all I like the flow of this pattern.[13/15]
 
Non-spell 3:
Same as non-spell 3 except that the pink wave is kinda intimidating, but I like it. [8/10]

Pure Rabbit "Hanami Dango"
Unique spellcard. I haven't seen this before (and hope it hasn't been used before because I want to give you a perfect score for creativity. xD) I love everything except those aimed large round bullets. I didn't expect them to be that fast and wide so I died on my 1st try. However, if I ignore that fact, this is a really good spellcard. [14/15]

"Effortless Dango Danmaku"
It's fun on the first few seconds, but it gets dull as the time goes on. There is nothing to dodge except super-slow large round bullets and the fact that I've to keep circling around Ringo. Although, the last 10 seconds is pretty exciting. [10/15]

Danmaku Score = (15/90)*(7.5+13+8.5+13+8+14+10) = 12.33
 
-Visual- (2 point)
It's nothing special but nothing bad either.
[0.75/2]
 
-Music- (1 point)
It's Junko theme! A remix right? Kinda unfitted for Ringo but I've a feeling that it fits this fight. xD
[0.75/1]
 
-Difficulty- (1 point)
Guess what? Your script is one of the most fairness script in this contest. Well done.
[1/1]
 
-Others- (1 point)
There is a dialogue. Hope there is a bit of an interaction between player and Ringo.
[0.25/1]
 
Total Score : 12.33+0.75+0.75+1+0.5 = 15.33
