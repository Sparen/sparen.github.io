LOCAA 8 Judgment - PhantomScream or PhantomSong or such
 
All judgments by me will follow the following rubric:
Danmaku Quality*: 14/20
Character Relevance & Creativity: 3/20
Aesthetics: 3/20
This is a change since last time - danmaku matters more. Because in my opinion it should.
*All patterns are given a score out of 10. Then the average of that is multiplied by 1.4 to get the score out of 14.
~~~
Nonspell 1: Fine thematically and gameplay-wise. 6/10.
 
Spell 1: I think this drags on for too long. Otherwise also fine~ 5.5/10.
 
Nonspell 2: Certainly fast-paced. A reasonable and simple challenge - I like it. 7/10.
 
Spell 2: Good. I...don't really have anything else to say other than 'good'. 6.5/10.
 
Spell 3: Not really all that great in my opinion. It's easy to be shoved into a corner given the walls of bubbles and the laser that lasts foreeeeeeeeeeeeever. It took me ages to finish this pattern, and it gets old pretty quickly. It doesn't really have any feel of cohesiveness - here's lots of bubbles and yama sticks. Have fun. Also 0,0 spawning after the pattern ended, be careful :P. 4/10.

Danmaku Quality: (6 + 5.5 + 7 + 6.5 + 4)/ 5 = 5.8*1.4 = 8.12
 
As for character relevance and creativity, the patterns certainly feel like Shikieiki's, though they're a lot of rehashed themes. Surely you could've done better than the bubble spam in the last card? 2/3.
 
Aesthetics: All around good. Nothing spectacular, but nothing ugly. Sounds are used appropriately, etc etc. 2/3.
 
Final Score: 8.12 + 2 + 2 = 12.12
