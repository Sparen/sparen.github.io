--Closing Thoughts--
 
Umm, Err.
This was certainly unique?
I really can't provide commentary to the patterns individually, This script? Entry? may end up disqualified.
From incredibly rough patterns, to the player not shooting when outside the play area, to no bounding box, to the hitboxes...
The patterns themselves aren't that bad but quite rough nonetheless (Such as 20 seconds of a single pattern that doesn't change and doesn't do anything else in the stage)

Uhhh, I mean. For Scratch this is pretty okay?
	But like, in Danmaku standards...
		Yeah.
