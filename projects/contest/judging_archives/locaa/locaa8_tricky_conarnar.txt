LOCAA 8 Judgment - Conargnar
 
All judgments by me will follow the following rubric:
Danmaku Quality*: 14/20
Character Relevance & Creativity: 3/20
Aesthetics: 3/20
This is a change since last time - danmaku matters more. Because in my opinion it should.
*All patterns are given a score out of 10. Then the average of that is multiplied by 1.4 to get the score out of 14.
~~~
Nonspell 1: Fine. Red stars on a red background is an interesting design choice. The bullets clump up, but fairly. 6.5/10.

Spell 1: The aimed stars shot after the aimed lasers accelerate way too quickly in my opinion. Otherwise a good pattern. 6/10.

Nonspell 2: A bit of a blue mess in my opinion but it's fine to dodge. 6/10.

Spell 2: Interesting. Fun, fair, and I just think it's pretty cool. 8/10.

Nonspell 3: Quite the green mess. Not really all that much to it. Do you really need to make the background the same color as the bullets you're firing? 5/10.

Spell 3: Neat. 7/10.

Nonspell 4: Now this is something cool. Seems a bit hard compared to some other things but shrug. 7/10.

Spell 4: Could probably benefit from everything not being purple. Also neat. 7/10.

Spell 5: The difficulty gets pretty insane near the end. Otherwise it's a fine multi-phase attack. 7/10.
 
Danmaku Quality: (6.5 + 6 + 6 + 8 + 5 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 7)/9 = 6.61*1.4 = 9.25/14.
 
As for character relevance, they're certainly Marisa. There are some pretty creative attacks as well. 2.5/3.
 
Aesthetics: All-around good. 2.5/3.
 
Final Score: 9.25 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 14.25
