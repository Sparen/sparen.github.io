UCC Judging - Lotus, Fallen from Grace
Player used: Marisa 
Difficulty Played: Original

Pattern judging:
 
--Stage Portion 1--
"omw to beat up tricky again" (8.5/10)
-As a Stage portion this works really nicely, The music synching elevates it to interesting lengths, almost reminiscent of Barrage Musical.
-I like the patterns used, While the rainbow shots and the aimed red arrowheads can get pretty cramped.

--Murasa Non--
"help me" (7/10)
-A pretty standard Murasa non, with all it's ups and downs.
-The added spread of bullets between waves makes things a little more interesting by filling out empty downtime.
-The synching between bars is really neat too.

--Stage Portion 2--
"summer snow incident intensifies" (8/10)
-Most of my thoughts here can be summarized in the last stage portion, really neat, music good, arrowheads scary.
-The Laser death fairy with the red arrowheads can be quite spooky but not too bad, A nice challenge.

--Shou Non--
"[insert curvy laser joke here]" (7/10)
-Really nice to look at this one, how the curvy lazors move around and stop.
-It's not too bad to dodge either! Very nice even while expecting shou shenanigans.

--Shou Spell-- Light Sign "Prominence of Dainichi Nyorai"
"two color slabs" (8.5/10)
-I enjoy the Miko reference here, It works quite nicely with Shou's laser spam.
-The pattern itself is also pretty nice, albeit a little bit random, It does look really nice to witness.
-But it's not too hard nor too easy.

--Stage Portion 3--
"red" (7/10)
-red
-red
 
--Byakuren Non 1--
"we getting JAZZY up in 'ere" (10/10)
-Can we can we can WE TALK about that ENTRANCE?!
-The switch between nameless path and makai is interesting, but the transition was handled really well.
-As for the pattern, Taking Miko's cues to throw Knives everywhere is really neat, But what's even better is the usage of one of her attacks in HM/ULiL, it works neat visually and keeps you on your toes.
 
--Byakuren Spell 1-- Law of Guanyin "Vajras of Purifying Light"
"no more vajras PLEASE" (8/10)
-I enjoy the usage of Byakuren's light blade thingies[tm], A really cool aspect of Byakuren that doesn't get too much usage.
-In here though, The spell can get quite cramped during the flash of light, which -while cool- can catch you off guard.
-The reference to Superhuman is also really good!
 
--Byakuren Non 2--
"WHY DOES EVERYONE WANT TO REFERENCE THIS WOMAN" (7.5/10)
-A Tsukasa non that is dodgeable.
-The lasers are able to apply quite a bit of pressure here, It kind of reminds me of Clownpiece's in her third non due to how much pressure it gives off.
-Aside from that, it's quite good anyways, having to lane switch in order to stay alive makes this spell quite fun to play.
 
--Byakuren Spell 2-- Enlightment "Golden Tailed Kuda-Gitsune's Dogma" 
"10/10 it has the little stars" (6.5/10)
-While it looks a bit daunting at first glance, this is actually pretty simple for a spell.
-The little charge effect for the lasers do prevent cheap shots by giving you just enough information, but not nearly enough for you to easily dodge them.
-It doesn't really change through the spell though, the little aimed stars force you to move but not too too much, sometimes becoming a nonissue.

--Byakuren Non 3--
"bethoven virus" (7.5/10)
-I never thought about combining Remilia with Byakuren's opener, it mixes really well thematically.
-The Meinster shots can be hard to predict as usual, specially the non-aimed spread, which can wall you if you're not careful.
-Some of the meinster's tiny bullets do linger during the next Opener, which can either make things interesting or hinder you depending on the person.

--Byakuren Spell 3-- Black Magic "Scalet Fantastica" 
"RED MAGIC PURPLE MAGIC" (9/10)
-This has a cheap shot at the start of the spell due to the speed of the bubbles, and potentially even bullets from the bottom of the screen?
-Aside from that, The combination of Scarlet Gensokyo and Flying Fantastica is really nice, And the spawning bullets create an interesting dynamic that alters how Flying Fantastica plays regularly.
-A very nice closing spell, shame about the difficulty though.
 
--Closing Thoughts--
 
Well, What can I say? I dig music synching a heck of a lot.
And being the second script to have an actual ~proper~ Stage in this contest really makes it feel more complete.
Such a shame that the synching doesn't extend to the boss itself, I would've loved something akin to BF's Stage 4 boss, But alas.

There are some really solid patterns here, as well as ideas that were pretty well executed, although with a few difficulty spikes that come out of nowhere, It still was really enjoyable to see, and play.
