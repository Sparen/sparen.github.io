LOCAA 8 Judgment - Maker of Wishes
 
All judgments by me will follow the following rubric:
Danmaku Quality*: 14/20
Character Relevance & Creativity: 3/20
Aesthetics: 3/20
This is a change since last time - danmaku matters more. Because in my opinion it should.
*All patterns are given a score out of 10. Then the average of that is multiplied by 1.4 to get the score out of 14.

Nonspell 1: Same old, same old. Something about this feels really sluggish to me. Not bad, not amazing. 5/10.

Spell 1: You probably should've had the familiars come in from offscreen to avoid killing the player if they're initially outside of them. Otherwise it's fine. Still feels really slow, but that's probably why it's doable. Not very fun. 4/10.  

Nonspell 2: Fine. Not much else to say about it. 6/10.

Spell 2: The feathers make...rather obnoxious noises. They're also very hard to see. Besides that, it's an okay pattern. 5/10.

Nonspell 3: Also fine. Everything is sooooo sloooooow. 6/10.  

Spell 3: Oh boy. Well, the gimmick isn't very apparent. If I never played ULiL I wouldn't even know where to start with clearing this attack. The purple things you're supposed to run into are quite difficult to see at best, and it's hard to get to them in the first place because she can just ram you anyway. I really don't like this. Such a gimmick would probably need a completely different pattern to be fair.  1.5/10.

Spell 4: Neat idea, but became really long and rather boring. Streaming plus some other stuff. Fine in moderation, but not really as the last spellcard. 4/10.
 
Danmaku Quality: (5 + 4 + 6 + 5 + 6 + 1.5 + 4)/7 = 4.5*1.4 = 6.3
 
The patterns do feel like ones Mokou (And Akyuu???) would use. They aren't amazingly creative though. 1.5/3. 
 
Aesthetics: They aesthetics could use some serious work. Master Spark's screen shake effect is fairly terrible, the key gimmick in the occult ball card is hard to see, Marisa's shots could be a lot more transparent since as they are now they just get in the way. Lots of problems. 0.5/3.
 
Final Score: 6.3 + 1.5 + 0.5 = 8.3/20
