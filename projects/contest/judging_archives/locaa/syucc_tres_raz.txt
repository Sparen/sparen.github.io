Marisa the Unconnected Spell Card Captor
Tsukasa non: 8/10
-A new twist on Tsukasa's nons. Tbh, it doesn't really feel like Tsukasa much but...
-It's close enough, and a nice pattern. The combination of walls and lanes overlapping forces you to move around the screen a lot.

Marisa Non 1: 8/10
-My first thought was, "you can't just add stars and call it a Marisa non!" But it's fine.
-Ultimately this spell is just streaming while dodging random spam, which is a tried and true combo.
-The wave of walls at the end mixes it up a bit too.

Marisa Spell 1: 7/10
-I don't really see the Lily influence here at all, but you're allowed one unthemed spell anyway so it's fine.
-I love the first half of the spell. The way it forces you to move away from Marisa and shoot the familiars, while also dodging walls and the star spam, it's very nice.
-But after playing it 4 times, I still don't understand what I'm supposed to do for the second half. No matter what I do, it always seems like there's a huge mob of familiars at the bottom of the screen, spawning too many bullets to reasonably dodge.

Marisa Non 2: 5/10
-I'll note that this really isn't a Marisa non in any way besides stars later, but won't detract from this patterns score for it.
-My biggest gripe is that there's really nothing to this pattern. It's wavy star lanes. The blue ice never gets close enough to you to be a threat at all.

Marisa Spell 2: 8/10
-It took me a while to understand this spell, but once I did it's a lot of fun.
-The aimed bullets force you to move in very strange ways, while the lasers and lanes box you in.
-Having bullets spawn right next to the player and expecting them to know to stream them is a bit of a cheapshot though. Maybe next time have an opening, easier wave to show that all the bullets are aimed?

Marisa Non 3: 4/10
-Using the dipper here is very cute, I have to say.
-The pattern itself is just a whole bunch of spam coming from multiple directions. There's really nothing of substance to it, even though it looks cool.

Marisa Spell 3: 10/10
-A great spell! The flood of orbs forces you to move from side to side, while the walls block you off. It's topped off with a variety of spam to further block your way and add some variety.

Marisa Spell 4: 9/10
-It's not very clear how to do the spell off the bat- I got forced to the top of the screen before I realized I had to shoot down the familiar.
-It's a decent pattern though. The aimed bullets are a bit inconquential, but they don't hurt the pattern either.
-The bullets flying both up and down are nice, and chasing the familiar forces you to opposite sides of the screen. The rising bullets from the bottom prevents you from camping on one side and just waiting for the familiar- if you do that, you'll get too high on the screen.

Theme adherence: 3/10
-The vast majority of the patterns are either just plain Marisa patterns without much to do with the other character, or character patterns that are only Marisa-like in that they use stars. It kind of defeats the idea of combining two characters' gimmicks.
-Overall: 62/90 = 68.8%
-I'm a bit sad, because I can tell how much effort went into making this. This script easily has one of the highest production values in the contest. You put your heart and soul into it.
-The biggest issue is that it just didn't adhere to the contest theme much. Rather than being a blend of Marisa's abilities with other characters', it felt more like a boss rush. I felt like I was fighting Lily, then Sekibanki, then Murasa with some Marisa patterns mixed in rather than fighitng Marisa using those characters' abilities. That doesn't make a bad script, but it did hurt your score a lot.
-For most of the patterns you were great at making me move around and do different things, which is what I want in a script, but you also had a handful of filler patterns that didn't really do anything special. These also dragged your score down a bit.
-I look forward to seeing more stuff from you.
