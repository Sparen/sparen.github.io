Someone who shares my name, what fun. The effect with the variable music was cool, though, and the attacks looked very nice.

-Cool lightning effect, not fun to dodge. Very thick and doesn't leave much room for error, but is rather 1 dimensional in terms of actual dodging content.

-Cool effect with the lasers, but I often find myself driven to the top of the screen, into a corner, and then shot dead. The random scattering of pellets leaves something to be desired.

-Very fun, I love dodging inside of the swirls. It's just claustrophobic enough to where you're nervous, but not to the point where it's brutally punishing.

-Best spell in the entire damn set. I love the way the pellets are shot from the larger rice bullets, then freeze, and then are pushed forward. It looks cool, it's fun,
and it's definitely the best in the set, but does leave the rest of them feeling very meh in comparison.

-Completely aimed giant bullets. Tap tap, you win, simple and serviceable. Nothing special, but nothing too bad, reminds me of mokou's Phoenix spell.

-Strange looking, and the giant laser walls don't feel like they serve much purpose, but the dodging of the fireballs is at least a little fun. The giant walls would have been better served not coming out of
nowhere, honestly.
