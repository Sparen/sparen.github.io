LOCAA 8 Judgment - Haru

All judgments by me will follow the following rubric:
Danmaku Quality*: 14/20
Character Relevance & Creativity: 3/20
Aesthetics: 3/20
This is a change since last time - danmaku matters more. Because in my opinion it should.
*All patterns are given a score out of 10. Then the average of that is multiplied by 1.4 to get the score out of 14.

Played on Normal??? mode.

Nonspell 1: Yay triangles. It's fine, if a bit long. 5/10. 

Spell 1: Well this is familiar. Also fine. Also very long. 5/10.

Nonspell 2: This drags on way too long in my opinion. It's pretty hard to stay directly under her, which just worsens the problem. 4/10.

Spell 2: This is also familiar, and painfully easy compared to the earlier attacks. Also drags on for waaaaaaaaaaay too long.  4/10.

Nonspell 3: Also feels way too long. Neat pattern otherwise. 5.5/10.

Spell 3: It's a neat attack as usual. But it's tooooo loooooong. I've been switching between the Red and Yellow shottypes and neither seems to beat these attacks much faster. 5.5/10.

Spell 4: Triangle survival. I really like the last phase. Good. 7/10.

Spell 5: Way too long. The first phase is...fine, but the second phase is random laser absurdity. The last phase is probably the easiest but by then I want to just be done with this script. 3/10. 

Danmaku Quality: (5 + 5 + 4 + 4 + 5.5 + 5.5 + 7 + 3)/8 = 4.875*1.4 = 6.825/14.
 
As for character relevance, all of the attacks feel character appropriate. Because they aren't very original. 1.5/3.
 
Aesthetics: Pretty pretty. 2.5/3.
 
Final Score: 6.825 + 1.5 + 2.5= 10.825
