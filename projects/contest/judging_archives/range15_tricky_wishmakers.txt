Range 15 Judging: Spooky Kogasa's Woo Or Something

All judgments by me will follow the following rubric:
Danmaku Quality*: 12/20
Character Relevance, Creativity, Originality: 4/20
Aesthetics: 4/20
 
*Is it fun to play? Cheap shots, boring sections, all things danmaku. Individual patterns will be graded out of 12 points, and then will be averaged.
 
Anyway, let's get started.
 
Nonspell 1: Certainly feels spirally, but by the time it reaches the player it kinda devolves into pseudowally nonsense. It doesn't stand out very much and feels disorganized. (5.75/12) 
 
Spell 1: Not all that interesting. Bouncy stuff under a mask of sorts that makes it a bit harder to see, but not much. Fine. 6/12.

Nonspell 2: My comments are literally the same as the first nonspell. 5.75/12.
 
Spell 2: This attack is good! Random (but not unmanagably random) falling bullets plus the occasional macrodgy thunderbolt + lingering bullets = great attack. Good job. I think the thunderbolts could happen more frequently, though. 8.75/12.

Nonspell 3: This attack is outright unreasonable to dodge with such a slow player. Will kill the player at least once due to not expecting the walls to be so unforgiving. The walls really shouldn't be so wide in this attack. The IDEA isn't bad, but the execution is. 3/12.

Spell 3: Interesting idea. I feel the area the player has to dodge in is simply too small, though. 6/12.

Spell 4: A really lengthy card that's not particularly fun to play. The player spends a large amount of time above the boss unable to hit her with the main shots, and it's simply a really slow card at first. When the Hina faces appear it doesn't feel all that much harder, and that's basically how the card remains as the wwwwwws don't do anything. Boring. 3/12. 
 

Danmaku Total: (5.75+6+5.75+8.75+3+6+3)/7 = 5.46
 
 
Creativity-wise, this is okay. The nonspells are horribly generic but the spellcards have some decent ideas here and there.
 
Creativity: 2/4.
 
Aesthetics are also fine. Nothing looks all that good, though nothing looks horribly bad either.  
 
Aesthetics: 2/4.
 
Total Score: 5.46+2+2 = 9.46
