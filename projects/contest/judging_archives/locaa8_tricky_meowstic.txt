LOCAA 8 Judgment - Meowstic
 
All judgments by me will follow the following rubric:
Danmaku Quality*: 14/20
Character Relevance & Creativity: 3/20
Aesthetics: 3/20
This is a change since last time - danmaku matters more. Because in my opinion it should.
*All patterns are given a score out of 10. Then the average of that is multiplied by 1.4 to get the score out of 14.
~~~
Midboss Nonspell 1: Simple and effective. Two types of dodging in close succession. I like it.  7/10.

Midboss Spell 1: Interesting patterns. The glowy balls after the explosion are...unexpected. Otherwise it's fine. 6/10.

And, now for the boss fight.

Nonspell 1: A combination of two Nue nonspells results in something quite fun! Great pattern. 8/10.

Spell 1: Hmm, it's fine. You have to move pretty far to dodge the aimed blue...blob? Not all that intuitive the first time, but fine afterwards. 6/10.  

Nonspell 2: The nonspell combinations continue. Also fun, though there could stand to be more time between the amulets and the balls. 6.5/10.

Spell 2: The blue lasers could be a bit easier to see, but otherwise I like it. Lots to focus on, lots to dodge. 7.5/10.

Nonspell 3: Another combination. I thought this one was a bit harder than the rest, but it could be just me. Also fine. 7/10. 

Spell 3: A bit plain compared to the rest of the fight. Fine, fine. 6/10.

Spell 4: I like the idea. I think the blue wave is a bit too sudden and can be pretty hard if it catches you off guard. 7/10.

Spell 5: Very cool idea, very fun to dodge. I think it simply gets too hard near the end, though. A nice way to finish things. 8/10.
 
Danmaku Quality: (7 + 6 + 8 + 6 + 6.5 + 7.5 + 7 + 6 + 7 + 8)/10 = 6.9*1.4 = 9.66/14.
 
As for character relevance and creativity, good job. You could've had a bit more nonspell variety beyond stuff she's already done, but that's not a major deal. 2.75/3.
 
Aesthetics: Good all around. The midboss spell background is much too bright if you ask me, and in general be careful with brightness. 2.5/3.
 
Final Score: 9.66 + 2.75 + 2.5 = 14.91
