LOCAA 8 Judgment - Lunarethic

All judgments by me will follow the following rubric:
Danmaku Quality*: 14/20
Character Relevance & Creativity: 3/20
Aesthetics: 3/20
This is a change since last time - danmaku matters more. Because in my opinion it should.
*All patterns are given a score out of 10. Then the average of that is multiplied by 1.4 to get the score out of 14.

Nonspell 1: Well, it's a Remilia nonspell. Nothing new, really. 6/10. 

Spell 1: I like this a lot! My main gripe is that it ends too soon, but maybe I was particularly good at following her? 8.5/10.

Nonspell 2: The knives make interesting formations, but there are windows when you're barely dodging anything. Fine. 6.5/10.

Spell 2: All around great! No real problems with this - lots of variety in dodging. 8/10.

Nonspell 3: I think those fireballs' trajectories can be a bit deceptive, but it's pretty good otherwise. 7/10.

Spell 3: Quite hard to read, but fun. The fireballs linger a tad much in my opinion but it's better than having to dodge literally nothing. 7/10.

Spell 4: Actually pretty boring if you ask me. Everything being shiny makes this a lot harder to play. When you get past that, it's just dodging randomish stuff in an enclosed space. Not that good of a way to end this script. 5/10.

Danmaku Quality: (6 + 8.5 + 6.5 + 8 + 7 + 7 + 5)/7 = 6.85*1.4 = 9.6/14.
 
As for character relevance, they do feel Remilia-esque and they are pretty creative. 2.5/3.
 
Aesthetics: Pretty gorgeous. Maybe you don't need THAT many ADD bullets, though. 2.75/3.
 
Final Score: 9.6 + 2.5 + 2.75 = 14.85
