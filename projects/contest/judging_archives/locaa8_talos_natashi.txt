-Danmaku- (15 point)
 
Non-spell 1 :
Nice non-spell. A bit random,though (I know it isn't random, but the way bullets move make it random.) [7.5/10]
 
Pheonix Sign "Shaping Fire Into Immortality"
Pheonix not Phoenix?
Well, doesn't like it matter xD Anyway, this spell is pretty cool. You nailed the phoenix-shape bullets. The problem is the danmaku. Sometimes, Mokou moves too low to the screen, making the Phoenix-shape bullets impossible to dodge because there aren't any gaps (unless I run to the left or right side of the screen,but it's probably too late by then) [11.5/15]
 
Non-spell 2 :
A bit harder than non-spell 1 but it's pretty good. I like fireballs [8/10]
 
Fire Sign "Inferno Barrier"
I like how you did with fireballs. They look really like a barrier. Although, I don't think super-fast wave of amulets is needed here.
[12.5/15]
 
Non-spell 3 :
It's a weird non-spell. The additive-blend knives don't fit well with the amulets, and they often come in a weird angle. Mokou also move way too much. If only Reimu has the homing shot... [6/10]
 
Grudge Sign "Curse of the Unforgiving Shrine"
Amulet everywhere ~
I feel uncomfortable while playing this spellcard. The amulet come from everywhere and there is a little time to prepare. (it would be a lot better if they start with 0 speed and a bit of acceleration.) [11/15]
 
"Iwasaka's Neverending Curse"
There're some questionable effect here. The danmaku is nothing special, just a re-skin of her last spell. The last phase look nice,though. [10/15]
 
God Sign "Kagu-Tsuchi's Inextinguishable Inferno Hell"
I got cheapshot at the start of spellcard.
It's a great pattern. I like the rainbow fireballs that you gradually spawn them. The simple circle ring is pretty fun to dodge. There is also a simple aim bullets which always force me to move. Yeah, it's a great pattern despite the cheapshot and impossible danmaku at the last 5 seconds. [13/15]
 
Danmaku Score = (15/105)*(7.5+11.5+8+12.5+6+11+10+13) = 11.36
 
-Visual- (2 point)
There're some effect that I've never seen before. Pretty good work. :)
[1.25/2]
 
-Music- (1 point)
It's original. What more can I say?
[0.75/1]
 
-Difficulty- (1 point)
The Reimu's speed is too high (especially focused speed), which make this script unnecessary hard. Otherwise, every pattern feel like they're the same difficulty. [0.5/1]
 
-Others- (1 point)
You made an unfinished HD script. Well, it's unfinished but at least you made something. [0.5/1]
 
 
Total Score : 11.36+1.25+0.75+0.5+0.5 = 14.36
