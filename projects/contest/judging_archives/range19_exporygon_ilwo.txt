Ilwo - Nitori

Spell 2: Really interesting use of the gimmick and I think it's the best designed and most fun attack in the script
Spell 3: Um, the way to dodge this is rather weird and unintuitive. It ALMOST looks like I can just move back and forth on the bottom during the bullet phasing but it just barely doesn't work. It took me a while to figure out that moving all over the screen (including towards the top) was the only feasible way to do it. Definitely my least favorite pattern of the script.
Spell 4: This one seems to have a lot of conflicting ideas. I thought at first that the hexagons that reveal the bullets were more helpful since it's impossible to see the green bullets otherwise. However I later figured out that the disappearing bullets are also harmless as long as they're invisible so the hexagons are actually a hindrance since they effectively put more bullets on screen. On top of all of that there are also rather fast fireballs, making the whole spell rather busy.
