CC Review - Seary Noxus (Searinox's Rumia and Mystia)
ia.

Danmaku Quality: The first nonspell is more of the same, I suppose. Kinda short but decently fun. The first spell, though an interesting idea, is really...silly to play. The white lasers caught me by surprise but I guess are dodgable if you're playing attention. This is where sound effects come in handy! Overall an okay pattern but I think the lasers are overbearing. 

The second nonspell is more Rumia-shooting-spellcards and Mystia shooting...stuff. The second spell is kinda neat but there's no indication that Mystia is going to ram you which makes it quite cheap. 

The third nonspell is cool but still feels like more of the same, while the third spell represents a rather large difficulty spike near the end. Cool idea but executed in a rather boring manner, all things considered.

This earns a 5.75/8 for Danmaku Quality. Some attacks are borderline overbearing or actually cheap, but overall fun enough to play.

Originality/Creativity: Nonspells are basically generic Mystia + Rumia's spellcards condensed, so not particularly original there. The Light-Blindness gimmick is quite neat but could've been executed better. This earns you a 4/8 for this category. 

Visuals, etc: Not many visuals to speak of. The Light-blindness is done well enough but otherwise it's unimpressive in this regard. 1.5/4.

Misc not-factored-into-score comments: You really should see about adding music and sfx to your scripts! They make scripts much more interesting!

Totals core: 5.75+4+1.5 = 11.25.
