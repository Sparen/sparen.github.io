LOCAA 8 Judgment - kirby-o

All judgments by me will follow the following rubric:
Danmaku Quality*: 14/20
Character Relevance & Creativity: 3/20
Aesthetics: 3/20
This is a change since last time - danmaku matters more. Because in my opinion it should.
*All patterns are given a score out of 10. Then the average of that is multiplied by 1.4 to get the score out of 14.
~~~
Nonspell 1: Simple and yet pretty good! The acceleration of the fireballs is a good design choice. 7.5/10. 

Spell 1: Very nice. Dodging stuff from all angles with some simple aimed shots to keep you moving. 8.5/10.

Nonspell 2: Nothing as special as the last two attacks in my opinion, but still fine. 6/10.

Spell 2: The second phase is the real challenge, but the second phase does take a while if you ask me. The flickering lasers are also a neat touch - but the first half is so easy and boring by comparison. 7/10.

Nonspell 3: Yay, dodging. Flickering bullets? Not bad, just...weird. 7/10.

Spell 3: I really like the challenge this card presents overall. All-around excellent! 9/10.

Spell 4: I think it would be better if the "safe" familiar was somewhere random in the ring instead of always being in the same spot. Would probably make this a lot more challenging. 7/10.

Spell 5: Quite the attack. Long, challenging, varied. Great. 8.5/10.

Danmaku Quality: (7.5 + 8.5 + 6 + 7 + 7 + 9 + 7 + 8.5)/8 = 7.5625*1.4 = 10.58/14.
 
As for character relevance, I'd say the patterns within feel Flandre enough. The attacks are quite brilliant. 3/3.
 
Aesthetics: No issues, all around excellent. 3/3.
 
Final Score: 10.58 + 3 + 3 = 16.58
