-Danmaku- (15 point)
 
Non-spell 1 :
A very creative non-spell. Each phase has a difference way to dodge. It's also very original. Amazing work. [9/10]

Seething Mist "Volcanic Disaster Fog"
Very nice use of familiars. The danmaku is extremely fun with the good use of fireballs (I like how they're not a plain circle) and arrow-head bullets. (they have good speed) [13.5/15]

Non-spell 2 :
Another great non-spell with an exceptionally good pattern. I've a blast while playing this. Absolutely great work.[9.5/10]

Aura Sign "Ki of the Four Heavenly Kings"
I like how you place the slowest pattern at the center of the screen, so even on the first try, the player still have time to prepare and dodge. (it's clever.)
The extra pattern after that is good, too. I especially like how you did with Junko pattern. It's at least interesting.
I forgot to mention that the effects you used are fascinating to see. I like it. :) [13/15]

Non-spell 3 :
It's a very well-designed non-spell. It has a nice difficulty curve, definitely fair to play with the player that has homing shot type. [9/10]

Primal Power "Oni God's Titanesque Step"
For the first part, this is how you make Junko pattern fun to play.
For the second part, it's a bit problematic if the player can't come back to the bottom of screen in time, because the danmaku from Suika is really dense. (and with the left-over gray bullet, it's much harder to do) It's still a good spellcard though. [12/15]

The Phantom Legion of Nurarihyon"
Wow wow wow what happen with the background!
and what's with that danmaku? Why it's so much fun to play with? It's very very creative and innovative. The last 10 seconds with the screen shake is also hella dramatic. Combining with the dynamic background that change as time goes on, I can definitely say this is one of the best survival spellcard I've even seen in danmaku community. Too bad for the sake of not being subjective, I can't give you max score (In fact you do get max score though) [14.5/15]

"Pandemonic Balance of Zoujou-ten"
It's a final spellcard that has a lot of final elements in it. It has nice difficulty, good use of danmaku that work well together, fair bullet speed, fun to dodge. I really like the gimmick with the Graze meter. It's brilliant. The pattern (after the graze reach zero) is quite deadly I must say. xD [14/15]
  
Danmaku Score =  (15/105)*(9+13.5+9.5+13+9+12+14.5+14) = 13.5
 
-Visual- (2 point)
The effect is neat. The background, while isn't outstanding, is simply beautiful enough. Good, good [1.5/2]

-Music- (1 point)
Good stage theme, sync well with the stage portion.
Boss theme is very melodic and I'm getting addicted to it.
[1/1]

-Difficulty- (1 point)
Fair and fun. I've yet to tried lunatic because it's beyond my skill. The normal is really good already and I've no complaint.
[1/1]
 
-Others- (1 point)
Freaking good stage and midboss. I couldn't give any better score.
[1/1]
 
Total Score : 13.5+1.5+1+1+1 = 18

P.S. I save the best script for last. Seem like I wasn't wrong. xD
