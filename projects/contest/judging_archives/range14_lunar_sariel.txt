[Sariel] Alice (Hard Mode)

[Danmaku = 7.3/10]
All spells and nonspells including midboss are very flashy
However the nons could use some work, it's pretty simple patterns even for Alice
and it looks like you we're going for PCB Alice patterns, but it's nice your adding more to it
Than doing the exact thing PCB did, The Spells however have a distinct resemblance from that of Faries of Sorcery
Either way, you make use Alice's dolls nicely but I've probably seen these gimmicks once already

[Balancing = 1.6/2]
For Hard Mode, this is Really Hard Mode, its not bad but it's going back and forth
almost crossing the borders of Normal and Lunatic

[Aesthetics = 3.9/5]
Additive blend works nicely with dark background you took advantage of that nicely
Except for the nonspells since that Makai BG is fairly bright

[Overall Enjoyment = 2.1/3]

[Final Score = 14.9/20]
To be honest the midboss Shinki had a much more interesting spellcard than Alice
But even if she does, Alice herself we're doing interesting things with
Her own patterns and aesthetics are pretty nice, try to touch up the nonspells a
Bit even if I think your going for PCB Alice
