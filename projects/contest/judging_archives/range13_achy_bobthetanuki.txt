Danmaku Quality: 7/8 These patterns are pretty nice! Nothing unfair seems to plague the script. There was a little bit of an error with Sanae still firing after Suwako started talking about "retreated".

Contest Theme: 7.5/8 Both characters are pretty accurate to how they normally attack with their opposite ability! Nice of you to spice up Suwako's non-spells too.

Music, Graphics, Appeal: 2.8/4 So that's what behind all this!
