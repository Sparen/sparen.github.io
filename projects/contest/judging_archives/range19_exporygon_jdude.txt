Non 1 - This attack's sudden aimed bullets have killed me 3 separate times while playing to judge. They're really cheap unless you know they're coming and need to be telegraphed a lot more.
Non 3 - By the time the attack gets interesting, I've already depleted 3/4s of the health bar. It's way too slow to ramp up.
Spell 3 - Um, I think the bomb must have killed the sources of the star bullets somehow, cause I managed to cause the spell to only shoot the fast red bullets.
Spell 4 - Definitely the most interesting pattern in an otherwise fairly uninteresting fight.

General Notes - Most patterns have too much life, a lot of bullet patterns are pretty slow and a bit boring and most of them aren't super original.
