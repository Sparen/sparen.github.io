CC Review - Kirbio's Entry Where Kyouko is Silenced and You Don't Have Any Status Effect Removers (Mystia and Kyouko)

^ maybe a bit long winded for a joke title

Anyway, let's get on with it.

Danmaku Quality: At first glance the first nonspell seems to open up with more of the same, but then Kyouku...silences? the bullets. Very interesting and a good twist. The first spell is rather simple, but as an opening spell I suppose you can't do ridiculous things off the bat. As a general theme, spells are quite a bit harder than nonspells but it's not TOO ridiculous. Enough of a disrepancy to matter, though.

The second nonspell is more of the first, and I usually hate it when nonspells are slight variations of others. These variations are much more than slight, though, and the second non is just as fun as the first. If not more fun! The second spell is also another cool idea. I think the portion where the purple amulets explode might be a tad too fast but it could just be me. 

The third nonspell is really scary, until you realize that the glowy bullets vanish before falling very far. The third spell is a survival, but it's relatively short for a survival and ends before it gets boring. The gimmick is a nice reversal of Mystia's ability and makes sense. The last spell is a good way to finish off the script (vocal spark!), though I wish the last phase started a bit earlier so the player would be truly light-blind for some time. I also think the spark happens rather quickly and could use a few more frames of delay.

Danmaku Quality gets a 7 from me.

Originality and Creativity and Stuff: I felt like I was fighting an inversion of Mystia and Kyouko. This is a good thing. I quite liked the ideas presented and their method of presentation. This earns a solid 7.3.

Visuals, Effects, Etc: This script does look quite nice visually. The dialogue events were well done and everything is generally good to look at. This earns a 3.

7+7.3+3= a total of 17.3
