I'm not sure exactly what to say about this one.

The first nonspell seems to start out quite Patchouli-like, but I have little to no idea as to what the second and third nonspells have to do with either Patchouli, Tewi, or the opposite of either of them. The second nonspell in particular is full of cheapshots - the acceleration in the bullets is almost unbearable. This is rather outstanding, because the rest of the script has a balanced difficulty. 

As for the spells, I can't complain too much, but I would like to say that since you were making a double boss fight, you could have had a spell where Patchouli and Tewi were more equally important - the first two spells had a heavy emphasis on Patchouli, while the third spell excludes Patchouli altogether. What I mean is, they could have worked together a bit more. Kind of like how they did in the first nonspell. I think my most favourite attack would have to be Five Leaf Clover. However, I think the emphasis should be on the clover itself -- perhaps you can make more clovers, and just have the decorative bullets be less dense. As it is, I feel that the clover is being obscured by everything else...

As a final note, I feel like this boss fight did not really fulfill the purpose of the contest -- or rather, I could not see how either the danmaku or the spell names reflected the "inversion" of Patchouli and Tewi's abilities. Then again, such things as "ability" can be interpreted quite differently. But, if I couldn't detect that an interpretation and attempt at inversion had been made, then I suppose I would have to dock points for that.
