Danmaku Quality: 5.8/8 Pretty solid, can't think of much to say here. It looked pretty fair. Maybe Letty's clouds could be tinkered with so that they don't get so close to you (Excluding "Blazing Hail Storm. I think the clouds aiming for you works well there.).

Contest Theme: 6.8/8 Lily felt like she was a bit recolored at the start, but I see that there are new things for her, and it still feels like it's her. I can't imagine she was easy to work with for this contest. Letty's new spells were pretty good at keeping to how she usually attacks.

Music, Graphics, Appeal: 3/4 Nice touch that the player's abilites are also reversed! Thanks for including a graphic level option. I got lag anyway (I was at half frame rate pretty much the whole fight), but still. And Thanks for including a practice player. I'm quite new to actually playing touhou related things.
