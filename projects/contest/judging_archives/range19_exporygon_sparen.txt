Non 1 - I like the shader effect and it's pretty unique but it can be pretty hard to tell where the bullets actually are, especially when they're coming at you at an angle.
Spell 1 - Um, this only happened once so I'm not going to dock points or anything but the whole screen just went black. I actually had to restart Danmakufu to get it to stop happening, really bizarre. https://puu.sh/AWywh/a961c475e3.png
Spell 2 - This is surprisingly fair despite the screen shaking and motion blur. I like it.
Spell 4 - I actually felt pretty underwhelmed by this spell after the dialogue built it up. It's not as interesting pattern-wise as I would have expected, though it does look pretty. Also what was that thing falling inside the HUD at the start? It didn't really do anything that I saw.

General Notes - The fact that this script focuses on visual fuckery instead of the usual Reisen gimmicks is a double edged sword. On one hand, it's pretty unique and very visually pleasing. On the other hand, screwing with the visuals can be very hard to do in a fun or fair way (see ZUN's Seija and my Darkrai script for some not so great examples).
