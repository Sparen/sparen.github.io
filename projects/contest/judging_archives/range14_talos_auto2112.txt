-Danmaku- (15 point)

Non-spell 1 :
This nonspell is impossible. Unless Rumia move to the upper of screen, you always die to the rainbow waves.
[7/15]

Creeping Darkness "Black Shadow in the Mist"
It's an alright spell card. Sadly, Rumia isn't last long enough, making a gimmick in this card seem kind of pointless.
[15/20]

Non-spell 2 :
I love this kind of nonspell.
[13/15]

Shadow Sign "What Lurks in the Deep Fog"
An ok gimmick, but bullets are too random. Not fun.
[12/20]

Nonspell 3 :
No. Please don't make this. It's not Rumia, more like a copy of Yuyuko's non-spell from TD.
[8/15]

Darkness Sign "Light in the Cold Abyss"
Now this is a big no no. I got killed instantly when spell started, and then I've absolutely no idea how to dodge this (yeah, I understand the gimmick,but that doesn't help me to survive)
This kind of pattern should be in a camera game, or something like single script , where you can trial and error it until you can pass them, otherwise, NO.
[5/15]

Overall, for the main boss fight you get 8.57 points out of 15

-Visual & Effect- (3 point)
Visual & effect are nice. I can tell you didn't make some of them, but it isn't against the rules. Anyway, you should give the creators a credit. Do not claim it as your own. (I say this because I look up at your folder and can't find any credit file.)
[1.5/3]

-Others (Difficulty,Aesthetics) - (2 point)
Difficulty is pretty bullshit in non-spell 1 and spell 3. Others are good.
Music fit the fight well.
[0.75/2]

Extra Credit (Stage,Midboss,Player,Gimmick,etc) (1 points).
I would give you some score if you made the players by yourself. Sadly, you didn't.
wait...you have a last word, but I can't play it. Don't know why.

##### Final Score = 8.57+1.5+0.75 = 10.82 #####
