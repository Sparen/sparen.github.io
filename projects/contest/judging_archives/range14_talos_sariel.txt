-Danmaku- (15 point)

Non-spell 1 :
A re-create version of the original. It's pretty good, but nothing is interesting much.
[11/15]

Curse Sign "Hourai Doll"
Nice pattern here, I love how lasers are rotated, and effects are pretty, too.
[17.5/20]

Non-spell 2 :
This one is pretty challenging to dodge.
[13.5/15]

Semi-Automaton "Seeker Doll"
Very interesting gimmick, very nice pattern.However, it doesn't do anything much. The patrol dolls' bullets are pretty trivia,they don't cause me any problem at all.
[17/20]

Non-spell 3 :
I love how you change the colour between each wave.
Danmaku is fine.
[12.5/15]

Magical Rainbow Dolls "Prisma Quintet"
Again, nice gimmick (sometimes remind me of Reimu), but it could be better if only alice fire more pattern,rather than a circle pattern. Right now it's a bit boring.
[16/20]

Sinister Shadow Dolls "Laser Clip"
Wow, this one is pretty pretty. Hella fun to dodge. The chain-link pattern should be executed more frequent,though.
[18.5/20]

Overall, for the main boss fight you get 12.72 points out of 15

-Visual & Effect- (3 point)
Visual is beautiful, especially center screen, along with background.
Effects are magnificent, love every one of them.
[2.75/3]

-Others (Difficulty,Aesthetics) - (2 point)
Normal difficulty sure is a normal.
Hard difficulty feel like a harder version of normal (easier than it should be)
Music choice is questionable, didn't like that much.
[0.75/2]

Extra Credit (Stage,Midboss,Player,Gimmick,etc) (1 points)
A decent stage with good midboss.
[0.5/1]
