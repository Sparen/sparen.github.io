Crested judging for RaNGE 20: The Netherworld's Feast of Four Seasons by TTBD and Adam.
Script contains 4 nonspells and 4 spells.
Judged with the custom Reimu player on Normal and Legacy.

I will be judging based on danmaku design, with a high focus on balance and creativity second.
Aesthetics are fantastic and not distracting, so no penalty will be issued.

Nonspell 1: These multiphase nons are always breathtaking. Good pattern.
18/20

Spring Sign "Veil of Ghastly Cherry Blossoms": Not just pretty but offers a unique challenge of streaming while dodging bullets from the side and back. It's a little easy, but that's fine.
19/20

Nonspell 2: The whole pattern consists of roughly aimed components, which honestly makes it a little boring since there's not much else to get in the way of streaming.
14/20

Summer Sign "Sunny Pinwheel": A very well-made chasing spell.
19/20

Nonspell 3: Good pattern with a good density at one point. The first part is too easy, though.
16/20

Autumn Sign "Golden Gust": Another very creative pattern though on the easy side. Admittedly I'm a bit spoiled by a similar spell in FDF2 but the gravity adds a unique challenge.
18/20

Nonspell 4: The lasers provide just the right amount of movement restriction with the unfolding waves. Fantastic pattern.
20/20

Winter Sign "Frozen Gravestone": The aimed portion here works much better since there is resistance to it making for a fun pattern.
19/20

Overall: 17.9/20
Very well-made script. It's a little on the easy side but the patterns' creativity make up for it on its own.
(Lunatic is a better balanced difficulty, in my opinion.)
