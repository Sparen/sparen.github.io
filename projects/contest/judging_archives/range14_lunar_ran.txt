[Ran Yakumo] Utusho (Default Difficulty)

[Danmaku = 3.10/10]
Let me get this out of the way, those nonspells are bad
their not for Utsuho at all, not even fun to dodge
the spells are harder to dodge and random due to the fact
of how your slow your player is

[Balancing = 0.50/2]
I just dont get it, these are extremely large bullets that
have some mysterious force in them that makes me die or not
the balancing is not great

[Aesthetics = 2.1/5]
Sad to say the effects department wont be pulling up the score here
that spell background is nice tho definitely orignal too but otherwise
something like the nuclear sign explosion is too bright

[Overall Enjoyment = 1.10/3]

[Final Score = 6.8/20]
This is sadly not fun to play through, danmaku needs perfecting
it does not fit for Utsuho at all, not even close for any character
definitely not fun to dodge too, and the exploding effects are allover
that said, aethetics are ok but danmaku is the most important part of scripts
you need to make sure you dont neglect them
