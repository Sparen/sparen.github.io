-Danmaku- (15 point)

Midboss : Alice  

Non-spell 1 :
Pretty cool-looking non-spell. The danmaku fit Alice perfectly, but I hope there's something more to spice it up. [8/10]

Puppeter Sign Sign "Pure Doll Army"
Pure stream spellcard with some circle danmaku. This one is special though. It's pretty fun to shift the player between the gap of lasers. However, it lasts a bit long because of how hard of it to hit Alice, and the fact that Reimu doesn't use Homing shot, but it's still a good spellcard. [12.5/15]

Boss : Shinki

Non-spell 1 :
An ellipse familiars! It's quite rare to see someone use ellipse formula in danmaku. For this one it's pretty decent. You did good with bullets' speed manipulation. A bit repetitive due to the one layer pattern. [7.5/10]

Ritual "Shinki's Golden Room" :
The effects are intimidating at first, but that keep the player from being cheapshot by familiar. I appreciate it. As for the pattern, it's fun indeed. The sheer amount of lasers, and how they're spawned, are great. [13/15]

Non-spell 2 :
Now this is what I call multilayer pattern. You added in the bubbles, turning the non-spell into a new level. It's fun, and have a good design. [8.5/10]

Illusionary Magic "Endless Xiohoid Arctifact" :
What a cool spell. Very nice effect. The pattern is good and dramatic to play with. The only problem I have with is the delay before the bullets are spawned along the lasers. It's a bit too short. Sometimes, I die on the very first second I see it (yellow wave and green wave). The other waves are fine. (the purple wave looks great I've to say.) The pattern after the Shinki come back is good,too. I like the pacing, and I love how I can decide between dodging inside or outside the familiar. Really nice design. [12.5/15]

"Makai's Divine Shield" :
Wow! a lot of things are going on here. It's somehow hard to judge xD, but I will see what can I do. For me, all of pattern play differently which is a good thing. The only pattern that gave me a trouble is the yellow phase (same problem as the surival spellcard). The other phases are very good already. The last 20 seconds is extremely brutal if you ask me. :D [13.5/15]

Danmaku Score = (15/90)*(8+12.5+7.5+13+8.5+12.5+13.5) = 12.58
 
-Visual- (2 point)
The stage background is really good. The spell background is kind of a let down, though. The effects are superb and you used them well.
[1.5/2]
 
-Music- (1 point)
The music fit the atmosphere of the script and I enjoy listening to it.
[1/1]
 
-Difficulty- (1 point)
It's quite hard but also fair. Despite the lasers that I mentioned you did well with this part.
[0.75/1]
 
-Others- (1 point)
The stage is a nice addition although there is not much going for it.(Danmaku-wise, circle-shape fairies are a nice touch though) Dialogue is not really necessary considering there isn't any story behind it, but it's not bad to be there. Oh, I forgot to mention that center screen look really nice,too.
[0.75/1]
 
Total Score : 12.58+1.5+1+0.75+0.75 = 16.58
