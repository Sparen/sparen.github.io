[TrickySticks] Sakuya (Original Mode)

[Danmaku = 7/10]
I like how your doing your patterns, both nons and spells
but it seems that if it goes on for too long.
it makes things clutter up the screen, while there are some that
clutter the screen on purpose,Spell 1 has a nice gimmick to it,I like it
Spell 2 is not sakuya, its more like suika and the Last card is way to simple

[Balancing = 1.30/2]
Im having a hard time scoring this, because there instances where the patterns
are way to easy but sometimes hard, so I will give you points for diversity
but in the end the bullets would still cover the screen anyways

[Aesthetics = 3.60/5]
It's pretty, that's all. you were going for simplicity
no over fancy effects and definitely stock background
but its simple in that its great.I'll leave it at that

[Overall Enjoyment = 1.65/3]

[Final Score = 13.55/20]
This is quite the script, I like it, as for enjoyment
there were times when I felt cheated on like Spell 1 and 3
and sometimes nervewrecked because of the bullets
but it alteast makes it fun
