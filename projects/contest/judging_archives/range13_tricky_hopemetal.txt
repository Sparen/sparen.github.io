Contradictory Catastrophe - Pachuuli and roomia by Really Long Name (Patchy and Rumia by HopeMetal)
i can't come up with something witty so bleh

Danmaku Quality: The first nonspell opens with bullets traveling at awkward trajectories and Tewi aggressively lasering you. Interesting. Should be interesting but honestly isn't. The spellcard comes down to just oddly moving blue bullets that explode into more bullets after a while which is KINDA cool but you have to wait for quite a long time before the bullets explode, and when they do it's quite sudden but ultimately fine afterwards.

The second nonspell features Patchouli bullets flying at the speed of actual bullets (way too fast). Compared to these Tewi might as well not even be there because of how ridiculous that bullet speed is. Certainly not a fair attack at the very least. The second spell IMMEDIATELY opens with a short delay laser that's likely to cheapshot anyone (certainly did to me). Once you get past that you have abruptly stopping knives that are a cool idea but are really hard to get used to, and a bunch of aimed blue orbs that are fine. A bit superfluous since you already have the white lasers, though. 

The third nonspell is okay. You should tone down the maximum speed of the orange bullets. The third spell is initially pretty cool but then everything accelerates and clumps up forming really hard to read walls. 

dat exit animation tho

For Danmaku Quality I'll give you a 3.5. Not completely unworkable or impossible, but you have a long way to go.

Originality and Creativity give you a 4. The attacks aren't really unoriginal per se, but they feel pretty generic and not like the opposite of...anything, really. The few non-generic ideas were poorly executed, like those knives.

Visuals get you a 1. There's no backgrounds, Tewi isn't animated, the patterns aren't very interesting to look at, but at least Patchy has animations? Also some decent magic circles during spells.

3.5+4+1 = 8.5.
