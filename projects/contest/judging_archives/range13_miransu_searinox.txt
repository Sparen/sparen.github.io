Rumia and Mystia.

Can't say I'm not interested in seeing what this is like.

The first nonspell starts out strong, with Rumia's danmaku being quite Rumia-like, and Mystia's, Mystia-like. No complaints here.
However, the first spell is rather questionable. I know you're trying to subvert it such that instead of being merely "able to see around yourself", you are now "able to see everywhere but around yourself". I can see where you're trying to go with it, but no. Please. I can't see where I am exactly and therefore, I can't dodge. You're asking me to run around blindly in hopes of avoiding suicide.

The second nonspell comes back with a take on the first. It's okay.
I dunno what's happening with Mystia though. Trying to tackle you or something? How big is the hitbox? It's... okay, I suppose. at least it wasn't too threatening, unlike the previous spell.

The third nonspell is also a bit strange. Rumia is just bouncing around, and while it might be a bit surprising, it's no challenge at all.

Last but not least, the final spell. It's... well, I thought it was a survival spell, so that was a big mistake on my part. I was rather disappointed when I saw nothing happen. After retrying it in single mode, I saw the other phases. Well, at least they stack upon each other in a way which prevents the player from just circling around all the way through the spell. That's nice.

Not too shabby. However, the spells (the nonspells are fine) are either kind of bland or need to be reworked completely.
