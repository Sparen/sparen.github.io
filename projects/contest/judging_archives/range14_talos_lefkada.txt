-Danmaku- (15 point)

Nonspell 1 :
A good opening non-spell. If only you can get rid of bullets that spawned outside StgFrame (and killed me twice), I would like this more [11/15]

Paranoia "Fear of Fans' Crowd H-"
This is more like a fast-pace version of original Paranoia. While it suffered from unoriginality, it provied an innovative danmaku. Kinda like it.
[15.5/20]

Nonspell 2 :
Solid non-spell. Nuff said.
[12/15]

Schizophrenia Crisis "Distorted Reality H-"
Wow, I really like concept in this spell card. Damaku is also fair and fun
[18/20]

Non-spell 3 :
Decent non-spell. Kind of out of place for her character.
[10.5/15]

Perversion "Stalkers Standing in Your Shadow H-"
A good streaming pattern, a little bit too much with purple bullets though. (they're too fast)
[16.5/20]

Non-spell 4 :
I have some unfocused skill so I've no problems to dodge these kind of danmaku, and I found it quite fun & challenging.
[13/15]

Oversized Ego "Deified Personality -H-"
This is an interesting way to fire bullets. I've a fun moment when I've to dodge by finding the gaps between them.
However, I still got walls sometimes.
[16/20]

I'm going To Call you. EVERYTIME. H-"
A replicate version of ULiL, and it's done nicely. I don't have any complaint, except it's a bid long
[17/20]

"Philosophy of a Loved Idol H-"
Not much originality here.Still fun to dodge
[16/20]

Overall, for the main boss fight you get 12.125 points out of 15

-Visual & Effect- (3 point)
Visual is really good, the StgFrame, background, UI are perfect.
Effects are quite nice.
[2.75/3]

-Others (Difficulty,Aesthetics) - (2 point)
I feel like normal difficulty should be better, it's a bit bland compare to hard difficulty.
I want to like the music, but I cannot. After replaying this script for the 3rd time, I started to get a headache.
[0.75/2]

Extra Credit (Stage,Midboss,Player,Gimmick,etc) (1 points).
Players are pretty good! Will you release them in the future?
