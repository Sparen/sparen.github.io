-Danmaku- (15 point)

Non-spell 1 :
I got a little weird vibe here. The danmaku is pretty but the acceleration is...I don't know how to say :| . It's kinda uncomfortable to dodge. Maybe without the acceleration, this pattern would be better [7/10]

Flower Sign "Mandarin Blossom"
This is good! (Although a bit hard) I love how you executed the yellow wave and green wave. They use the same pattern,yet they play differently. It fits Meiling indeed. [12.5/15]

Non-spell 2 :
Pretty~ Nice use of Rainbow Bullets. Like their projectiles. Love Meiling's side kick. xD [8/10]

Martial Arts "Golden Dragon Flying Kick"
I assume those bunch of bullets represent the dragon, right? They are quite hard to dodge on the 1st try (because of their speed). The 2nd wave where they come horizontally is more tolerable. [11/15]

Qi Manipulation "Imbalanced Directional Energy"
Holla~~ One of the unique pattern I've ever seen (and I want to see more) Really like how you design the pattern so that players have to adapt their skill with this card's gimmick to overcome the different obstacle(danmaku). It's great. Well done. [13.5/15]

Purity "Qi Cycle"
For every spellcard this one is the slowest. The stream is pretty troublesome to dodge because it comes very slow (so if I move too much there will be bullets everywhere and no gap). The rest of patterns are good and pretty satisfying to dodge. [12/15]

Danmaku Score = (15/80)*(7+12.5+8+11+13.5+12) = 12.00
 
-Visual- (2 point)
Not much effect here. Not that it looks bad, though.
[0.75/2]

-Music- (1 point)
I don't know I've listened to this music already or not. It sounds familiar for me. It's ok, I guess?. xD
[0.75/1]
 
-Difficulty- (1 point)
Only one difficulty, it's around normal-hard (for me). No hardcore cheapshot so far so I would say it's pretty balanced.
[0.75/1]
 
-Others- (1 point)
I will give you a bit of point for Qi Manipulation "Imbalanced Directional Energy". :)
[0.25/1]
 
Total Score : 12+0.75+0.75+0.75+0.25 = 14.5
