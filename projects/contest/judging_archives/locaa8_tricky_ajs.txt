LOCAA 8 Judgment - AJS

All judgments by me will follow the following rubric:
Danmaku Quality*: 14/20
Character Relevance & Creativity: 3/20
Aesthetics: 3/20
This is a change since last time - danmaku matters more. Because in my opinion it should.
*All patterns are given a score out of 10. Then the average of that is multiplied by 1.4 to get the score out of 14.
~~~
Nonspell 1: Pretty cool. A simple twist on a simple pattern. 7.5/10. 

Spell 1: A sorta-streaming pattern that manages to stay interesting by incorporating good boss movement. Cool! 8.25/10.

Nonspell 2: The bullets move in wonky ways but it's not too bad to read. Also cool. 7.25/10.

Spell 2: A true charming siege from all sides. All-around excellent. I do disagree with using lightning lasers but shrug. 9/10.

Danmaku Quality: (7.5 + 8.25 + 7.25 + 9)/4 = 8*1.4 = 11.2/14.
 
As for character relevance, I'd say the attacks feel Ran enough. They're also very creative. 3/3.
 
Aesthetics: Excellent! 2.75/3.
 
Final Score: 11.2 + 3 + 2.75 = 16.95
