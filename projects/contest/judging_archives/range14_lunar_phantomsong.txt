[PhantomSong] Aya (Default Difficulty)

[Danmaku = 7.30/10]
Hmm...I had a tough time on what I think about this
definitely Aya patterns butm it may be too simple
i mean almost all of the nonspells are just solid circles
being thrown at you would have liked a variety the spells
are unique and very fast paced I do like that

[Balancing = 1.40/2]
since this is only one difficulty, I'll give you half
but the patterns still recommend micro and macrododging
in many forms so i like that but try not to make spell1
too much micro dodging like when those butterflies came

[Aesthetics = 3.10/5]
they're not special, but im not saying its bad
i actually like it, background is ok it gives a
soft feeling than its Autumn counterpart

[Overall Enjoyment = 1.40/3]

[Final Score = 13.2/20]
You have a sense of Aya in this script, theres fast bullets
arrowheads and Aya moves everyway great job but keep Aya
isnt suppose to be streaming patterns imo,still good job tho
