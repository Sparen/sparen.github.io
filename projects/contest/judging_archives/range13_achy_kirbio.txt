Danmaku Quality: 7.5/8 Despite my awful playing skill I can tell this is balanced well and, fair to play. The only thing that happened that I found cheap was Kyouko happened to ram into me during "Soundproof Wall", but she does go to that spot every time.

Contest Theme: 7.8/8 You nailed the theme IMO.

Music, Graphics, Appeal: 3.5/4 The dialog an introductions are an excellent touch. Is Seija reversed too? It seems like it. 
Infinite continues? Yes please!
