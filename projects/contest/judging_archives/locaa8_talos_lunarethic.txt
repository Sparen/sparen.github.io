-Danmaku- (15 point)
 
Non-spell 1 :
A very good opening non-spell. There are a lot of layers and all of them flow well together. Nice work indeed. [9/10]

Divine Atonement "Hell Scarlet"
I like how the knives are spawned. Very refreshing and fun spellcard. The extra circle bullets from Reimilia has a nice amount of bullets on it so that the player need to pay attention. [13.5/15]

Non-spell 2 :
Nice spawning position for bullets. Look interesting to play and fun to dodge. [8.5/10]

Meister Sign "Midnight Crimson"
A pretty cool spellcard that has a lot of cool danmaku. However, it's a bit cheap with bullet spawning from behind and above. (and both happen nearly the same time.) [11.5/15]

Non-spell 3 :
Good use of randomness on the first part. The fireballs are nice but can be deadly.) [8/10]

God Art "Nightless Ruination"
I like how the bullets are spawned. The bullets from Remilia have good speed. It's a blast to dodge. However, I wish the lasers are spread out more. Right now they only cramp at the Remilia.
The timing between each wave is a bit too much that it look like it end really fast.
[12.5/15]

"The Daybreak of Midnight"
Epic lasers I've to say.
For the bullet part, I know there're pattern behind this but when they work together, they look kinda random. Not saying it's bad, I've fun dodging this.
It's also end very fast. Again, not a bad thing because it doesn't seem to have a lot of phase.
Overall, it's a good spellcard. It just doesn't have enough final-ish.
[12/15]
 
Danmaku Score =  (15/90)*(9+13.5+8.5+11.5+8+12.5+12) = 12.5
 
-Visual- (2 point)
The visual is a top notch. The effects are superb and well-used. The backgrounds are beautiful. Absolutely no complaint here.
[1.75/2]
 
-Music- (1 point)
It's not a Remilia them but it suits the fight well. The sound effects work very well with it.
[1/1]
 
-Difficulty- (1 point)
It's fair and fun for the most part, minus some spellcard that's a bit cheap.
[0.5/1]
 
-Others- (1 point)
I will give a bit score for the amount of effort you put on the effect. Very beautiful. xD
