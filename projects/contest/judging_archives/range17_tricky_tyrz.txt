Trickysticks here, judging another contest. Yay. This one involves lasers everywhere and only lasers. 

Scripts will be judged solely on gameplay. While the danmaku is the vast majority of this category, things like sound effects and graphic design choices do affect how the game plays. Scores will be calculated by rating every pattern out of 10, then taking the average of those values.

This review is for tyrz's contest entry. I played on Hard mode.

Attack 1: It's an opener! Nothing amazing, nothing bad. Be careful with all the pure randomness in the blue lasers. 5/10.

Attack 2: I mostly dodged this one by moving out of the giant mass of white lasers altogether, which meant that I timed it out. It's probably possible to do this spell by dodging within the lasers but they're random and it's not really worth the risk. Giving the player options is nice, but be careful with randomness to this much of a degree. 3/10.

Attack 3: The lasers are a bit hard to see, but the pattern is pretty okay to me. Fairly fun to dodge. 5.5/10.

Attack 4: Pretty stressful streaming. It's not the most original pattern, for sure, and the yellow lasers are as obnoxious as the originals. Altogether it's okay. 5/10.

Attack 5: It's a simple yet effective pattern. I found it fine, though the purple aimed lasers don't stand out much on such a dark background. 5.5/10

Attack 6: Ooh, laser's recitation. Dodging aimed stuff is a bit tiresome at this point since the last two patterns involve it. The purple lasers are really subtle, and when they're the main threat that's a bad thing. 4/10.

Attack 7: I wasn't expecting this to be a survival spell, but it's not bad. The blue lasers are also a bit hard to see on such a dark background, but the pattern is okay. A decent way to end things. 5/10.

Final Score: 4.71/10
