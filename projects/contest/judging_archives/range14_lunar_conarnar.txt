[Conarnar] Reisen (Default Difficulty)

[Danmaku = 5/10]
the patterns looks reisen enough, no cheapshot can happen
although some did go by too fast and the patterns that had gimmicks
and some that I have already seen before but i do
like the survival card alot its the first time ive seen something like that

[Balancing = 0.90/2]
this is definitely not too hard , moreover looks too easy
but then you took a curveball and made the survival card be
the fastest thing alive, but given the gimmick its forgivable

[Aesthetics = 2.12/5]
Not Moving BG! thats all I can say, also that text
that shows on the survival card are too stale
i prefer if you make it more colorful or have atleast a white border

[Overall Enjoyment = 1.80/3]

[Final Score = 10/20]
