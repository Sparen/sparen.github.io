[Fondue/Benwolf] Yukari (Default Difficulty)

[Danmaku = 6.10/10]
This is pretty much micrododging at its finest.
The danmaku and gimmicks isnt bad but it caught me off guard
most definitely the first spell. and the bullets just keeps
getting cluttered too much when yukari moves and shoots 10 times per second

[Balancing = 1.10/2]
this one's difficulty ramps up which is good
what makes it not good is how the bullets are either slow or fast
some are too fast and some are too slow and some are slow that becomes fast
but in the end its all micrododging so yeah...ok job though

[Aesthetics = 4.30/5]
Wow the concentration effect is very unique I like it
the stage background is simple but works
the cut-in is definitely unique
and the animation on that start up and that gap. I love it
great job it captures my eyes

[Overall Enjoyment = 2.5/3]

[Final Score = 14/20]
A solid fourteen, Danmaku has difficulty and balancing
was all over the place but the gimmick was fun though
albeit vague and definitely surprised me
