Bullet Hell Artistry #4: Unworldly Manifestations
Judging notes from Crested
"Bringer of the Mountain and Desert" by Drekareen
=======================================================================================================================================
My judging criteria is entirely based on pattern design with bonuses or penalties for other factors such as gameplay systems, presentation and creativity.
Each boss pattern will be rated up to 10 points and the overall score will be the average of all patterns.
=======================================================================================================================================
No difficulty options given.
What is a Hard Lunatic anyway

Non 1 - Multipart nons! It's a decent one too. 8/10
Spell 1 - A bit blind killer but the pattern itself is pretty good. Orange arrowheads being the main difficulty of the pattern seems a little strange though. 8/10
Non 2 - Those white lasers are super blind killer but it's a good non regardless. Something about the rainbow orbs looks... off though. 8/10
Spell 2 - The gravity only applying in three bursts seems a little... strange. It's a decent pattern otherwise. 8/10
Non 3 - Very well made non. 9/10
Spell 3 - Incredible spell. I absolutely adore the design of the 6 purple laser wave. 9/10
Non 4 - The perfect symmetry kind of makes this non a little underwhelming... but the laser phase makes up for it. 8/10
Spell 4 - It might be just a bunch of different patterns but they're all quite good. 8/10
Spell 5 - It feels like 4 completely different patterns in one spell, which doesn't really seem to be very fitting for a final. The patterns are decent though. 8/10

Bonus/Penalty - Standard boss fight script. Though I think the gameover function broke?

Overall Score - 8.3/10
It's pretty obvious from every single pattern in the script that you're more than capable of producing a lot of good quality patterns and quite a few of the patterns are highly thematic and creative. That said, I do feel like some of the ideas could have been explored a little more to produce one very well-made pattern, instead of having a multitude of different ideas thrown one after another.
