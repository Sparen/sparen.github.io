Badz's BHA2 Judging: Similarity Duo by Greg

The final score is out of 25, split as follows:

Gameplay: 15 points
How well the script plays. Each pattern is judged individually.
The individual scores are further split as 5/15 for concept and 10/15 for gameplay.

Creativity and theme: 5 points
How well the script uses the contest theme. Based on having a fitting pair of characters, and making good use of both of them.

Aesthetics and presentation: 5 points
How good the script looks and feels. Includes visuals, as well as other presentation aspects like sound effects and the system.

Creativity and theme: 3.75/5

Okay, that's a good meme.
Their danmaku styles are combined fairly well for the most part, save for the first two nonspells.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Aesthetics and presentation: 4/5
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Everything looks fine. The custom Junko sprite is a nice touch.

Gameplay: 10/15
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------
Nonspell 1
10/15 (3.5/5 | 6.5/10)

Junko's attack is the interesting part here, particularly when she's doing it solo. Okina is just providing random spam.

--------------------------------------------------
Spell 1: God Sign "Hidden God Surfing in a Sea of Bullets"
8.5/15 (3/5 | 5.5/10)

The concept has potential, but the pattern isn't particularly exciting.
This would've been a good place to do like the nonspells and have Okina fire something on her own after Junko is shot down.

--------------------------------------------------
Nonspell 2
8.5/15 (3/5 | 5.5/10)

It's all essentially random dodging. Junko's solo attack is pretty, but it's ridiculously hard to dodge.

--------------------------------------------------
Spell 2: Secret Ceremony "Pure Divine Spirit Offering"
11/15 (3.5/5 | 7.5/10)

It's unusual, and Junko firing one of Okina's spells outright is strange, but the resulting pattern is actually fairly interesting to dodge.

--------------------------------------------------
Nonspell 3
12.5/15 (4.5/5 | 8/10)

Now THIS is a nice one. It could use an indication that bullet lines are about to come in from below, though.
The combined pattern and Okina solo are both fun to dodge. Junko's solo attack feels unreasonable, though.

--------------------------------------------------
Spell 3: "Pristine Anarchy World"
9.5/15 (3.5/5 | 6/10)

I don't have much to say about this. It just works.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Final score: 17.75/25

Closing notes
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-I'm getting persistent lag on this script, even with the background completely removed. What's going on?
-Overall, it's a nice script, but the first half feels like it's not living up to its full potential.
