At the end, the total points will be divided by the total possible points, and then multiplied by <contest average> to get your final score.
 
Nonspell 1: 13.5/20
I like the bootleg Dream Sealing Circle she's using, and she's got some Shinki-like movement.  A very nostalgic non, pretty nice.
It's pretty standard otherwise, but a great start.
6.5/10 - Creativity/Aesthetics, 7/10 - Fun/Design

Unveil Danmaku Art "Disturbing An Old Text": 13/20
Grid of amulets where she fires a seal that makes some of them red and aimed?
Works extremely well thematically with the title, a little bit slow (so not as interesting to dodge) but this is pretty nice!
7/10 - Creativity/Aesthetics, 6/10 - Fun/Design

Nonspell 2: 17/20
This is VERY good.  Aesthetically it's got a nice theme, and I love how much this attack makes you think.
Even when you figure out the best way to approach it (dodge one flower, focus on amulets, dodge other flower) it keeps you on your toes.
Great work!!  The only quirk I have with it is how tough it is in comparison to everything else so far, haha
8/10 - Creativity/Aesthetics, 9/10 - Fun/Design

Thought Danmaku Art "Crystallized Knowledge": 18.5/20
Beautiful pattern aesthetic, simple in concept, fun to dodge.  My favorite kind of attack.
Is it the flashiest in the world?  Maybe not, but simplistic beauty is awesome.
9/10 - Creativity/Aesthetics, 9.5/10 - Fun/Design

Nonspell 3: 17/20
A new and slightly different take on the previous non with the amulets now needing to be approached from the corners.
Pay attention, newer scripters: THIS is how you make a previous non concept have a throughline, but make you approach the attack differently.
Anyway, quite nice.  Easier than the previous non, a slight knock for creativity, but is otherwise great.
8/10 - Creativity/Aesthetics, 9/10 - Fun/Design

Hanakotoba Danmaku Art "Flower Language": 14.5/20
Flowers coming from both Aisho and the corners from the telegraphed bubbles.
It's serviceable and somewhat pretty but I can't help but feel like it's a step down from the bangers that were the last three attacks.
7.5/10 - Creativity/Aesthetics, 7/10 - Fun/Design 

Nonspell 4: 15/20
I like this take on the first non more than the actual first non itself, haha.  A bit more fun to dodge, fairly basic, but good.
Aesthetically I like how the pellets are fired way more in this non.
7.5/10 - Creativity/Aesthetics, 7.5/10 - Fun/Design

"The Sword Who Shall Not Be Named": 15.5/20
Nice custom sword graphic haha.  Feels very Kaisendo, Mumei anyone?
Aesthetically it's VERY striking and it's got some great variety but I feel like it's one of the lesser attacks in the dodging category.
Very neat though.
9.5/10 - Creativity/Aesthetics, 6/10 - Fun/Design

Ancient Scripts "Millenium Eternia": 17/20
IN Fantasy Seal on crack.
Very neat attack base and the stuff that builds on top of it is meaningful.  That last phase is pretty gross but learning that I can tap stream it in a pinch helped.
I hope you can't tap stream the other phases honestly, I feel like it'd be less fun when you've got more room to move.  But I can't say I tested it.
Otherwise, fuckin cool.
8.5/10 - Creativity/Aesthetics, 8.5/10 - Fun/Design
 
AESTHETIC: 26/30
Looks: Script looks fantastic, multiple steps above normal DNH with a striking visual style.  Custom *everything* and the player portraits are adorable!! 9/10
Sound: Fairly standard SFX but gets the job done.  Neat custom music!  The boss music ending at the start of ending dialogue though is quite weird. 7/10
Polish: This script (and system in particular) oozes polish.  From the custom pause menu, widescreen adaptation, the ending replay screen, custom cancel handling... it's great.
It's the kind of system I'm honestly striving to make right now.  Perfect score. 10/10
 
SUM OF PATTERNS: 141/180
AESTHETIC: 26/30
TOTAL: 167/210 * 25 = 19.88/25

Dude, this script is rad as hell.  I loved playing it, it's one of the stand out scripts in this entire contest imo
There's a few weird points I neglected to mention - for example, the player speeds are *weird*.  I don't really know why.
But besides a couple weird oddities like that (and a couple patterns lower on the tier list) this was an incredibly solid script and you should be proud of it.  Excellent job!
