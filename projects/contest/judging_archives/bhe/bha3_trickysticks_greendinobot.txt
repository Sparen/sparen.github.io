Bullet Hell Artistry #3 - GreenDinobot
For this contest I'm using a 25 point rating scale so I don't get fined.
 
Danmaku Quality: 15/25
 
Danmaku Quality encompasses the quality of the danmaku in your script. "Good" patterns will equal a "good" score in this category. What makes a pattern good is subjective, but the #1 factor is fun. A flashy, gorgeous pattern that isn't fun won't fare well here. Note that aesthetic factors can still factor into this - proper usage of sound effects and graphics can make an unfair pattern fair, and improper usage of those can make an otherwise-fair pattern unfair.

To be more clear, an "average" pattern is a 5. You can gain or lose points and I'll probably tell you why.
 
Individual patterns will be rated out of 10. The average of that will be taken and scaled to calculate the Danmaku Quality score.
 
Aesthetics: 5/25
 
This category encompasses how your entry looks (and sounds). While danmaku should absolutely come first, visual and audio elements are also a part of the gameplay experience.
 
Final Boss-ness: 5/25
 
5 points will be dedicated to how well the character feels transformed into a final boss. It's a judgment of how their themes translate into a more "serious" fight. Mostly subjective, but I'll try to give detail about why I rated something highly/lowly in this category. 
======================================================================================================================

Nonspell 1: Pretty good opening non; appropriate variation of Hina's usual themes for a final boss's opener. Tough but doable. 7/10.

Spell 1: A pretty straightforward (but dense) pattern. I'm particularly bad at stuff coming from the sides and I would caution you to make contest scripts easier for judges of lower skill levels. 6.5/10.

Nonspell 2: Interesting non! Feels true to the character while exploring new space. I like this. 8/10.

Spell 2: I kind of just treat this one as a spell where you almost never unfocus, which isn't actually that interesting. The intent is presumably to stream/unfocus when safe. With all of that in mind I'll say it's a solid 7/10.

Nonspell 3: Feels less interesting than the previous and a bit less interesting as the first one. 7/10.

Spell 3: Neat idea for a gimmick, just not sure if I actually liked dodging it that much? I do like how one of the phases encourages you to rotate around the screen, but the doll gets in the way of your attempts to do damage while also being something you want to hide behind sometimes. 6.25/10.

Nonspell 4: omg bowap. The amulet amulets don't look that good in my opinion, though the ice crystal...crystals...look quite nice. Pattern-wise it's a variant on the usual Hina. 7.75/10.

Spell 4: The slowing of the player is another fairly interesting gimmick. For the LONGEST time I thought you had to dodge those red bullets the familiars make and I thought this spell was nonsense - something should be done to differentiate them from regular shots. Once you understand the gimmick, the pattern improves quite a bit, the problem is getting to that point. 5.5/10.

Spell 5: Good multi-phased script ender. Gets quite tough near the end! 8/10.

Danmaku Score: 7/10 (scaled to 10.5/15)

I'm going to dock a point here for the high difficulty though. That makes the score 9.5 instead.
======================================================================================================================
 
Aesthetically, I'd say this script is a bit above average. I don't really like the LCD aesthetic that much and there's some weird choices like the amulet-amulets, but on the other hand those don't detract from the quality too much and there's some neat things like the boss sprite itself. 2.75/5.
======================================================================================================================
 
I think the script's final boss-ness is pretty good. A multi-phase script ender goes a long way, and the nonspells are pretty long. 3.75/5.
 
OVERALL SCORE 9.5 + 2.75 + 3.75 = 16/25
