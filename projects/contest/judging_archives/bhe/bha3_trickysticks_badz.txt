Bullet Hell Artistry #3 - Badz
For this contest I'm using a 25 point rating scale so I don't get fined.
 
Danmaku Quality: 15/25
 
Danmaku Quality encompasses the quality of the danmaku in your script. "Good" patterns will equal a "good" score in this category. What makes a pattern good is subjective, but the #1 factor is fun. A flashy, gorgeous pattern that isn't fun won't fare well here. Note that aesthetic factors can still factor into this - proper usage of sound effects and graphics can make an unfair pattern fair, and improper usage of those can make an otherwise-fair pattern unfair.

To be more clear, an "average" pattern is a 5. You can gain or lose points and I'll probably tell you why.
 
Individual patterns will be rated out of 10. The average of that will be taken and scaled to calculate the Danmaku Quality score.
 
Aesthetics: 5/25
 
This category encompasses how your entry looks (and sounds). While danmaku should absolutely come first, visual and audio elements are also a part of the gameplay experience.
 
Final Boss-ness: 5/25
 
5 points will be dedicated to how well the character feels transformed into a final boss. It's a judgment of how their themes translate into a more "serious" fight. Mostly subjective, but I'll try to give detail about why I rated something highly/lowly in this category. 
======================================================================================================================

Played on Hard Mode.

Nonspell 1: Very solid start. 7.75/10.

Spell 1: Also a solid pattern. The knives that come from behind aren't a surprise at all since they stay there spinning for a while. Good! 8/10.

Nonspell 2: Feels like hectic fun. 8/10.

Spell 2: Fun and fair spellcard. I like the warning indicators for the blue wolf heads. 8/10.

Nonspell 3: I quite like the idea behind this non, and it's immediately intuitive to dodge. 8.5/10.

Spell 3: You probably don't need to give THAT much time after the demonstration wave, but that's a minor flaw. This is still a fun pattern. Maybe not as interesting as some previous ones, but it's good. 7.5/10.

Nonspell 4: Now this one resulted in me not actually dodging that many bullets - maybe I got lucky, but it was just chilling between lasers and ignoring bullet clusters for the most part. Still fine. 6.5/10.

Spell 4: Pretty easy once you understand the gimmick - looking at the spell named helped unironically. Tough if you don't just rotate in the center, but quite easy if you do. 7/10.

Spell 5: Good multi-phase script ender. It's nice to fight a spell like this where the boss chases you around. 8/10.

Danmaku Score: 7.69/10 (scaled to 11.54/15)
======================================================================================================================
 
Aesthetically, I'd say this script is a decent bit above average. Nothing groundbreaking, but it's aesthetically pleasing and cohesive. 3.5/5.
======================================================================================================================
 
I think the script's final boss-ness is a bit above average. Patterns are very short for a final boss, but the last pattern is good enough to elevate you above averager. 2.75/5.
 
OVERALL SCORE 11.54 + 3.5 + 2.75 = 17.79/25
