Bullet Hell Artistry #3 - Hoagie
For this contest I'm using a 25 point rating scale so I don't get fined.
 
Danmaku Quality: 15/25
 
Danmaku Quality encompasses the quality of the danmaku in your script. "Good" patterns will equal a "good" score in this category. What makes a pattern good is subjective, but the #1 factor is fun. A flashy, gorgeous pattern that isn't fun won't fare well here. Note that aesthetic factors can still factor into this - proper usage of sound effects and graphics can make an unfair pattern fair, and improper usage of those can make an otherwise-fair pattern unfair.

To be more clear, an "average" pattern is a 5. You can gain or lose points and I'll probably tell you why.
 
Individual patterns will be rated out of 10. The average of that will be taken and scaled to calculate the Danmaku Quality score.
 
Aesthetics: 5/25
 
This category encompasses how your entry looks (and sounds). While danmaku should absolutely come first, visual and audio elements are also a part of the gameplay experience.
 
Final Boss-ness: 5/25
 
5 points will be dedicated to how well the character feels transformed into a final boss. It's a judgment of how their themes translate into a more "serious" fight. Mostly subjective, but I'll try to give detail about why I rated something highly/lowly in this category.

Played with Reimu

Nonspell 1: This is REALLY hard. When the waves overlap I don't think it's reasonable to expect me to dodge this, but it's maybe a tough challenge otherwise. 2/10.

Spell 1: Much easier than the previous non, and seems to have a glaring safespot (I wrote this comment while sitting in the safespot)  4/10.

Nonspell 2: The first non, but a lot more reasonable. I think it's definitely tough but actually kind of fun. 4/10.

Spell 2: This spell would be more reasonable if the rings of arrowheads had like half the amount of bullets they do. Otherwise it's pretty tough but probably doable by a better player. 3.5/10.

Nonspell 3: With this one it would be kind of tough, but you identify a safe lane in the arrowheads and just dodge the balls within it. Not that interesting as a result. 3.5/10.

Spell 3: Pretty easy compared to previous patterns. Not a bad thing in this case, I think this pattern is decent. 6/10.

Spell 4: Doable pattern, just takes a very long time to die. Very long. I-timed-this-out long. 2.5/10.

Spell 5: An interesting idea but it's WAY too hard. Being sucked into the middle just adds to the already-high difficulty. 2.5/10.

Danmaku Score: 3.5/10 (scaled to 5.25/15)
======================================================================================================================
 
Aesthetically, I'd say this script is above average. Ryannlib is pretty good, who knew. 3/5.
======================================================================================================================
 
I think this script's final boss-ness is...maybe a tad below average? 2/5.
 
OVERALL SCORE 5.25 + 3 + 2 = 10.25/25
