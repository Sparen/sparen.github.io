Bullet Hell Artistry #2: Unlikely Allies
Judging notes from Crested
"Ashes of Jeweled Treasures" by Ryann1908
==========================================================
Judging criteria and point distribution are as follows:
Playability - Gameplay (max 15 points)
Creativity - Contest Theme (max 5 points)
Aesthetics - Appearance (max 5 points)
Max score per judge is 25.
==========================================================
Gameplay - For gameplay, I will score each pattern individually and average the scores to get the final gameplay score.
 
Before I get to the boss fight... I hate this stage section why did you even do this.
Also why is the Spell Practice menu order reversed... and could you make the bosses have the actual correct HP in practice mode...

Non 1 - Shou's lasers are such a random mess that this pattern just feels like a total jumble. Something's also not right with Seiga's lasers. 11/15
Spell 1 - It's a much more structured pattern, but Seiga's bullets feel more like Kagerou...? It also doesn't even have enough HP to see the whole pattern. 13/15
Non 2 - Why did you make Shou a homing bullet. The randomness of Seiga's pattern makes this also really inconsistent. 11/15
Spell 2 - This not only lags like hell, there's also no reason for the gimmick... the pattern's practically ruined by the effect. 6/15
Non 3 - Despite being again, horribly random, it's actually decent. 13/15
Spell 3 - I mean, despite being Len'en, this is still way too simple. Shou does force movement, but it's really basic... 10/15
Spell 4 - I get the idea but good grief it's not doable. Again, falls victim to some unbalanced RNG nonsense with wonky hitboxes. I don't get the final part of the spell at all either. 10/15
Spell 5v1 - Why are the bullets pulsing. The pattern works, but why. 13/15
Spell 5v2 - Would you look at that, an actual standard and good pattern! 13.5/15
Spell 5v3 - The jellybean bullets are interesting but what's up with the blue lasers? 13.5/15
Spell 6 - I hope you were just memeing because this pattern is a mess at the bottom and completely free at the sides. 9/15

Overall Gameplay - 11.2/15
Unbelievably gimmicky but somehow ended up okay.
==========================================================
Creativity (Contest Theme) - 3.5/5 (Okay)
Was this supposed to be a meme script? I don't even know what the theme of this script was.
==========================================================
Aesthetics - 4/5 (Functional)
It works just fine and doesn't interfere with the dodging. No, wacky UI doesn't give more points.
==========================================================
Total Score - 18.7/25
I don't know what I played, but it feels like it's all just too random to tell.
