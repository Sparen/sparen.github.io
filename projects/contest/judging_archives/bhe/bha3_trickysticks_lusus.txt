Bullet Hell Artistry #3 - Lusus
For this contest I'm using a 25 point rating scale so I don't get fined.
 
Danmaku Quality: 15/25
 
Danmaku Quality encompasses the quality of the danmaku in your script. "Good" patterns will equal a "good" score in this category. What makes a pattern good is subjective, but the #1 factor is fun. A flashy, gorgeous pattern that isn't fun won't fare well here. Note that aesthetic factors can still factor into this - proper usage of sound effects and graphics can make an unfair pattern fair, and improper usage of those can make an otherwise-fair pattern unfair.

To be more clear, an "average" pattern is a 5. You can gain or lose points and I'll probably tell you why.
 
Individual patterns will be rated out of 10. The average of that will be taken and scaled to calculate the Danmaku Quality score.
 
Aesthetics: 5/25
 
This category encompasses how your entry looks (and sounds). While danmaku should absolutely come first, visual and audio elements are also a part of the gameplay experience.
 
Final Boss-ness: 5/25
 
5 points will be dedicated to how well the character feels transformed into a final boss. It's a judgment of how their themes translate into a more "serious" fight. Mostly subjective, but I'll try to give detail about why I rated something highly/lowly in this category.

Played on Legacy for less suffering.

Nonspell 1: Dodging in the lanes with the balls is still POSSIBLE but Jesus Christ it's hard. Luckily you can completely avoid said balls by picking another lane. A good variant on fishgirl's usual. 7.75/10.

Spell 1: Another good spellcard. Nothing super interesting, but it's short enough and good to dodge. 7.5/10.

Nonspell 2: She channels her inner Junko, but it's infinitely more interesting than anything Junko ever did. I like the first non better but this is still quite decent. 7.25/10.

Spell 2: It's fun streaming through trigonometricky[sic]. Good. 7.5/10.

Nonspell 3: Feels a little harder than the other nons, but it's still fine. 7/10.

Spell 3: Bouncing done well. 7.25/10.

Nonspell 4: Another variant of Circles. Like it more than the previous. 7.25/10.

Spell 4: Forces aggressive dodging. I quite like this. 8/10.

Spell 5: Simon says that I actually quite like. I'm VERY happy it's not random every wave. 8/10.

Spell 6: This one is kind of weird because I feel compelled to dash between bullets when they still have their full(?) hitboxes. I feel like the hitbox should shrink as the bullet does. Otherwise I like the idea - it's just stressful and a little bit janky 6.5/10.

Danmaku Score: 7.4/10 (scaled to 11.1/15)
======================================================================================================================
 
Aesthetically, the script is above average. It's cohesive, just nothing super fancy that stands out. 3.25/5.
======================================================================================================================
 
The final-bossness is above-average. A lot of the patterns are pretty short and simple for a final boss, and I think those tend to have slightly more complex patterns. It does have a survival and multi-phase finisher. 3/5
 
OVERALL SCORE 11.1 + 3.25 + 3 = 17.35/25
