Bullet Hell Artistry #3 - Luminous
For this contest I'm using a 25 point rating scale so I don't get fined.
 
Danmaku Quality: 15/25
 
Danmaku Quality encompasses the quality of the danmaku in your script. "Good" patterns will equal a "good" score in this category. What makes a pattern good is subjective, but the #1 factor is fun. A flashy, gorgeous pattern that isn't fun won't fare well here. Note that aesthetic factors can still factor into this - proper usage of sound effects and graphics can make an unfair pattern fair, and improper usage of those can make an otherwise-fair pattern unfair.

To be more clear, an "average" pattern is a 5. You can gain or lose points and I'll probably tell you why.
 
Individual patterns will be rated out of 10. The average of that will be taken and scaled to calculate the Danmaku Quality score.
 
Aesthetics: 5/25
 
This category encompasses how your entry looks (and sounds). While danmaku should absolutely come first, visual and audio elements are also a part of the gameplay experience.
 
Final Boss-ness: 5/25
 
5 points will be dedicated to how well the character feels transformed into a final boss. It's a judgment of how their themes translate into a more "serious" fight. Mostly subjective, but I'll try to give detail about why I rated something highly/lowly in this category. 
======================================================================================================================

Played as "reibu". What's a reibu? Lumi...

Nonspell 1: Oh, we're basing it off of THAT ExRumia, aren't we. I think it's not really all that interesting but slightly above average. 5.5/10.

Spell 1: I see the inspiration. I like this a good bit more than the previous non - it's pretty interesting to dodge. Not super exciting or anything, but gooder. 7/10.

Nonspell 2: Simple variant of the previous non. Pretty decent, 6.25/10.

Spell 2: This pattern is a very neat idea! It starts making weird walls/has bullets coming from behind you if you take a while, and as someone who died immediately it did take a while. I assume it's supposed to die quick like most patterns, but I don't think the weirdness if you prolong things is intended? If the pattern were more reasonable without speedkilling it I'd rate it higher, but with that flaw I'd just give it a 5/10.

Nonspell 3: V a r i a n t. Not that exciting. Slightly better than the first? 5.75/10.

Spell 3: Go to middle is illegal 0/10. Just kidding. What SHOULD be illegal is how loud those laser sounds are. The pattern is tough-but-fair otherwise, the go-to-middle is an amusing nod to something else, but the pattern's not really that fun to dodge and my EARS. I'd rate it solidly average. 5/10. 

Nonspell 4: Now it's streaming, yay. I'd say this is actually a below-average streaming pattern, to be honest? It's below average on fun, less fun than patterns that are literally JUST aimed bullets without residual crap to move through. 4/10.

Spell 4: Very unfun spinning that takes ages and makes me want to commit UaUP. 1/10.

Spell 5: It's micrododging of dawn alright. Tight micrododges, way harder than the rest of the patterns, doesn't really have a nice dramatic buildup like most final boss scripts. Below average for sure, but not unsalvageable. 2.5/10.
 
Danmaku Score: 4.389/10 (scaled to 6.583/15)
======================================================================================================================
 
Aesthetically I'd call this below-average. Not because of ice mountain and default assets - if anything I really don't mind those. But between the music not looping (unless I broke something???) and the utter ear murder of those lasers I'm taking off half a point. 2/5.
======================================================================================================================
 
As a final-boss, I don't think you did that good of a job. Pacing-wise, some of the patterns felt like slicing through butter with a hot woo, while others took a while. The final pattern didn't really have a climatic build-up. Just...eh. A bit below average. 2/5
 
OVERALL SCORE 6.583 + 2 + 2 = 10.58/25
