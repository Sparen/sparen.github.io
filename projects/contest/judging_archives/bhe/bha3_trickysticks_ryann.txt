Bullet Hell Artistry #3 - Hiro/RYANNNNN
For this contest I'm using a 25 point rating scale so I don't get fined.
 
Danmaku Quality: 15/25
 
Danmaku Quality encompasses the quality of the danmaku in your script. "Good" patterns will equal a "good" score in this category. What makes a pattern good is subjective, but the #1 factor is fun. A flashy, gorgeous pattern that isn't fun won't fare well here. Note that aesthetic factors can still factor into this - proper usage of sound effects and graphics can make an unfair pattern fair, and improper usage of those can make an otherwise-fair pattern unfair.

To be more clear, an "average" pattern is a 5. You can gain or lose points and I'll probably tell you why.
 
Individual patterns will be rated out of 10. The average of that will be taken and scaled to calculate the Danmaku Quality score.
 
Aesthetics: 5/25
 
This category encompasses how your entry looks (and sounds). While danmaku should absolutely come first, visual and audio elements are also a part of the gameplay experience.
 
Final Boss-ness: 5/25
 
5 points will be dedicated to how well the character feels transformed into a final boss. It's a judgment of how their themes translate into a more "serious" fight. Mostly subjective, but I'll try to give detail about why I rated something highly/lowly in this category. 
======================================================================================================================

Played normal mode.

Stage Section I Can't Judge Or I'll be Fined (But I'll Comment Anyway): The gimmick of shooting down a lot of stuff is actually kind of difficult to achieve. That makes it meaningful, so good job. Cirno's non is neat. Why is she a Dyke. Overall, good and interesting. Difficulty balance seems a little jumpy at fine but nothing super egregious. Would give it a 7-8ish out of 10. 

Nonspell 1: Decently fun opener. Not very "pretty" but it gets the job done. Solid work. 7.5/10.

Spell 1: Oh dear, big whirling white things falling down. Macro them or die. Seems solid. 7.25/10.

Nonspell 2: Honestly it took me a while to even notice bullets actually wrapped around here. The gimmick exists, but I ended up just chilling near the bottom and not needing to dodge very much. 6.75/10.

Spell 2: The spell being dodgable from both inside and outside of the...what the hell is a hawser...is good design. I like this one quite a bit. 8/10.

Shou Shows Up: wtf/10

Nonspell 3: Weird pattern. Fun enough, but weird. 6.75/10.

Spell 3: A "the boss invades your personal space" spell that gives plenty of time to see that she's coming and route her appropriately. I like this one. 8/10. 

Nonspell 4: Alpha Bubbles :0. Otherwise, not a lot to say about this one. Decently fun, kind of slow-paced compared to the rest. 6.75/10.

Spell 4: Spending like half the spell unable to shoot her is pretty unsatisfying in my opinion. In fact, a lot of this is relatively unsatisfying dodging within a narrow lane. Good idea, but the execution just seems average. 5/10.

Spell 5: I think you should really make the boss untargetable during survival cards since I thought you had to shoot her for like...most of this. Besides that, I find this pattern shockingly difficult when compared to the rest of the script. Also the name is weird. Altogether I'd rate this a 6/10.

Spell 6: wow it's the name of the script. Anyway, this is a solid multi-phase script ending thingy. 7.5/10.
 
Danmaku Score: 6.95/10 (scaled to 10.425/15)
======================================================================================================================
 
Aesthetically I actually quite like this. Sound effects were used well, the visuals are nice, and it doesn't completely reek of default LuaSTD. 3.75/5.
======================================================================================================================
 
As a final boss, I think you did fairly well. The...weird interlude didn't really help your case, but it didn't hurt it too much either. Pacing got a little weird with nonspell 4, but I still like it overall. 3.25/5
 
OVERALL SCORE 10.425 + 3.75 + 3.25 = 17.425/25
