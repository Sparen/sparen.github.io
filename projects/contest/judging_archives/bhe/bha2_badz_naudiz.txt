Badz's BHA2 Judging: Perfect Form by Naudiz
Played on Smooth mode

The final score is out of 25, split as follows:

Gameplay: 15 points
How well the script plays. Each pattern is judged individually.
The individual scores are further split as 5/15 for concept and 10/15 for gameplay.

Creativity and theme: 5 points
How well the script uses the contest theme. Based on having a fitting pair of characters, and making good use of both of them.

Aesthetics and presentation: 5 points
How good the script looks and feels. Includes visuals, as well as other presentation aspects like sound effects and the system.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Creativity and theme: 5/5
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yeah, there's no contest here. This script goes above and beyond with making use of its theme, integrating it into just about every aspect of the game.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Aesthetics and presentation: 5/5
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is also excellent, with a lot of unique assets and a nice package.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gameplay: 10.6/15
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------
Nonspell 1
8.5/15 (3.5/5 | 5/10)

The VD-esque circle is neat, but the optimal way to dodge this is to tap away once when the aimed shots fire. Not particularly exciting.

--------------------------------------------------
Spell 1: Pure Sign "Refinement of the Red Orb"
11.5/15 (4.5/5 | 7/10)

A very clever twist on Circle Creature.
Junko's charge effect covers up the warning lines close to her, though, which makes it a lot more annoying than it needs to be.

--------------------------------------------------
Nonspell 2
10.5/15 (3.5/5 | 7/10)

Not much to say on this. It just works.

--------------------------------------------------
Spell 2: Square Shape "Blue Cube Creatures"
10.5/15 (4.5/5 | 6/10)

It looks very nice, but it has a very long setup phase without much happening.

--------------------------------------------------
Nonspell 3
10/15 (3.5/5 | 6.5/10)

Overall, it's all fine, but not the most exciting thing either.

--------------------------------------------------
Spell 3: Hope "The True Form of Pandora's Box"
8.5/15 (3.5/5 | 5/10)

This takes a long while to build up into a dangerous pattern, and it's basically over by the time it can reach that state.

--------------------------------------------------
Nonspell 4
10.5/15 (4/5 | 6.5/10)

I like the combination of spells, but the player will be standing still a lot of the time.
The solo attacks are more interesting to dodge, at least.

--------------------------------------------------
Spell 4: Cyberbrain "A Round Cog in a Rectangular Machine"
11.5/15 (4.5/5 | 7/10)

It's a very unique pattern, but also a very awkward one that I'm not sure how to handle properly. How are you supposed to get around the corners?

--------------------------------------------------
Spell 5: "Geometry of the Despised (Cavalerius Versus Cartesius)"
12/15 (4.5/5 | 7.5/10)

Simple and effective. My only complaint would be that Junko's rings get a bit tight in the first phase, especially for something you're forced to dodge unfocused.

--------------------------------------------------
Spell 6: "Forma Perfecta"
13/15 (4.5/5 | 8.5/10)

Creative, unique, and fitting for the script's theme. An excellent way to finish it off.

Final score: 20.6/25

Closing notes
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-My skill level felt like a real curse when judging this. Smooth mode was easy enough to be boring, but Rough mode was too much for me to handle.
-Overall, it's a beautiful script with a lot of very interesting ideas, just with slightly boring execution sometimes.
