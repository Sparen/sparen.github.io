Bullet Hell Artistry #3 - Kusa
For this contest I'm using a 25 point rating scale so I don't get fined.
 
Danmaku Quality: 15/25
 
Danmaku Quality encompasses the quality of the danmaku in your script. "Good" patterns will equal a "good" score in this category. What makes a pattern good is subjective, but the #1 factor is fun. A flashy, gorgeous pattern that isn't fun won't fare well here. Note that aesthetic factors can still factor into this - proper usage of sound effects and graphics can make an unfair pattern fair, and improper usage of those can make an otherwise-fair pattern unfair.

To be more clear, an "average" pattern is a 5. You can gain or lose points and I'll probably tell you why.
 
Individual patterns will be rated out of 10. The average of that will be taken and scaled to calculate the Danmaku Quality score.
 
Aesthetics: 5/25
 
This category encompasses how your entry looks (and sounds). While danmaku should absolutely come first, visual and audio elements are also a part of the gameplay experience.
 
Final Boss-ness: 5/25
 
5 points will be dedicated to how well the character feels transformed into a final boss. It's a judgment of how their themes translate into a more "serious" fight. Mostly subjective, but I'll try to give detail about why I rated something highly/lowly in this category. 
======================================================================================================================

Nonspell 1: Seems pretty fine. You might want to turn off the angular velocity on those things at some point because they're kind of weird to dodge. 6.25/10.

Spell 1: Also seems fine; just not super interesting in my opinion. Oddly difficult for how sparse the bullets are. 6.25/10.

Nonspell 2: More fun variant of the first non, I'd say? 6.5/10.

Spell 2: I actually this is a good pattern. Kind of janky since it's hard to tell which direction the aimed portion comes from at first and dodging towards it doesn't lead to good outcomes (probably). 7.5/10.

Nonspell 3: Another pretty decent non; better than the previous two 6.75/10.

Spell 3: Interesting idea, but I find that it's very impractical to go chase the orbs in an effort to catch them. Seems impractical to grab them after the second/third. It's good for you to spell out the gimmick though!  6/10.

Nonspell 4: Another variant on previous themes. This one seems like the bullets can randomly clump from time to time, but it might just be my imagination and I had no trouble navigating those clumps. 6.75/10.

Spell 4: Fine; not super interesting in my opinion. The angular velocity on those amulets is kind of irritating. 6.5/10.

Spell 5: I actually like the idea for this, and the execution is decent too. I had some weirdness occur where one of the boxes was deleted (thanks broken version of Ultima Reimu). Still, neat! 8.25/10.

Spell 6: Pretty fine ending to the script. It feels like the phases go by really quick, but it might be that I'm doing good DPS. 7.25/10.

Danmaku Score: 6.8/10 (scaled to 10.2/15)
======================================================================================================================
 
Aesthetically, I'd say this script is slightly below average. I REALLY don't like the spell background much. 2.25/5.
======================================================================================================================
 
I think the script's final boss-ness is about average too. Nothing really stood out in a good or bad way. 2.5/5.
 
OVERALL SCORE 10.20 + 2.25 + 2.5 = 14.95/25
