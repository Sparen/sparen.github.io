Bullet Hell Artistry #3 - Adam
For this contest I'm using a 25 point rating scale so I don't get fined.
 
Danmaku Quality: 15/25
 
Danmaku Quality encompasses the quality of the danmaku in your script. "Good" patterns will equal a "good" score in this category. What makes a pattern good is subjective, but the #1 factor is fun. A flashy, gorgeous pattern that isn't fun won't fare well here. Note that aesthetic factors can still factor into this - proper usage of sound effects and graphics can make an unfair pattern fair, and improper usage of those can make an otherwise-fair pattern unfair.

To be more clear, an "average" pattern is a 5. You can gain or lose points and I'll probably tell you why.
 
Individual patterns will be rated out of 10. The average of that will be taken and scaled to calculate the Danmaku Quality score.
 
Aesthetics: 5/25
 
This category encompasses how your entry looks (and sounds). While danmaku should absolutely come first, visual and audio elements are also a part of the gameplay experience.
 
Final Boss-ness: 5/25
 
5 points will be dedicated to how well the character feels transformed into a final boss. It's a judgment of how their themes translate into a more "serious" fight. Mostly subjective, but I'll try to give detail about why I rated something highly/lowly in this category.

Played on Hard Mode with ReimuSpring

Midboss Non: Excellent! I'm really bad at the curvy bullets but that's just me. Can't judge this though.

==ACTUALLY JUDGED STUFF BELOW==

Nonspell 1: Very good nonspell. The aimed(?) element keeps you moving. 8.75/10.

Spell 1: I like this spell as well. Still keeps you moving, just like the previous non. 8.5/10.

Nonspell 2: Another great nonspell. I got a 0,0 spawning error which doesn't really matter. 8.75/10.

Spell 2: Excellent pattern here too. The rotating caught me a little off guard but it was very easy to get used to.  8.5/10.

Nonspell 3: I was going to say this was really trivial, but then the spirals of bullets started overlapping in interesting ways. I still think it's a bit too easy compared to previous nons, but it's not egregiously so. 8/10.

Spell 3: Butterfly amulets are neat! Otherwise I really like how this spell plays - I think it gives a bunch of options for how you dodge the aimed bullets from the lanterns. Very good. 9/10.

Nonspell 4: Not as complex as some of the previous nons, but that's not exactly a bad thing considernig the previous nonspells are amazing. 8.25/10.

Spell 4: I like how one lantern directs you towards the next lantern that's going to "go off". I quite like this pattern too. 8.5/10.

Danmaku Score: 8.53/10 (scaled to 12.80/15)
======================================================================================================================
 
Aesthetically, I'd say this script is very much above average. There's a lot of animation frames on the boss sprites in particular, the fluttering butterly amulets are awesome, and sound effects are used very well. Excellent work! 4.5/5.
======================================================================================================================
 
I think the script's final boss-ness is above average for sure. It's a bit short for one, but the patterns are high-quality. 3.75/5.
 
OVERALL SCORE 12.80 + 4.5 + 3.75 = 21.05/25
