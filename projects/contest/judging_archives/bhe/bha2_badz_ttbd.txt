Badz's BHA2 Judging: Shipwreck Showdown by ttbd
Played on Normal mode

The final score is out of 25, split as follows:

Gameplay: 15 points
How well the script plays. Each pattern is judged individually.
The individual scores are further split as 5/15 for concept and 10/15 for gameplay.

Creativity and theme: 5 points
How well the script uses the contest theme. Based on having a fitting pair of characters, and making good use of both of them.

Aesthetics and presentation: 5 points
How good the script looks and feels. Includes visuals, as well as other presentation aspects like sound effects and the system.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Creativity and theme: 2.5/5
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The characters do fit and they work together, but 4/7 of the patterns have them going solo. The "team battle" aspect isn't quite there.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Aesthetics and presentation: 5/5
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The visual effects look nice, and there are some less common ones like a boss intro. This is excellent.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gameplay: 11.5/15
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------
Nonspell 1
10.5/15 (3.5/5 | 7/10)

Komachi's alternating attacks here make for a nice flow. Keeping up with the Murasa's scattered droplets is a pain, though.

--------------------------------------------------
Spell 1
11/15 (3/5 | 8/10)

Fun macrododging with a lot of variety!
My only complaint is more of a conceptual one: Komachi doesn't contribute much at all here.

--------------------------------------------------
Komachi's nonspell
11.5/15 (4.5/5 | 7/10)

Ooooh, that scythe attack is cool.
The rest of the pattern isn't too special, though.

--------------------------------------------------
Komachi's spell
12.5/15 (5/5 | 7.5/10)

Now THERE's an interesting gimmick!
The danmaku is very chaotic (maybe a little too much), and yet there are enough indicators to keep track of the player's soul. Nicely done.

--------------------------------------------------
Murasa's nonspell
12/15 (4/5 | 8/10)

More fun macrododging! I can't complain about anything here.

--------------------------------------------------
Murasa's spell
11/15 (3.5/5 | 7.5/10)

It's a solid spinning pattern. There's not much to say about this one.

--------------------------------------------------
Final spell
12.5/15 (4.5/5 | 8/10)

Avoiding Komachi's giant waves while luring Murasa around is fun.
Though the danmaku can be a pain sometimes, with things coming from really awkward positions.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Final score: 19/25
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Closing notes
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-I like the fast-paced danmaku here, but as a side effect, what you call "Normal mode" is significantly crazier than the usual Normal mode fare.
-Overall, it's a fun boss fight with a distinct danmaku style.
