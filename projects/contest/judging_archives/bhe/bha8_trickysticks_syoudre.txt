Bullet Hell Artistry #8 - Syoudre
For this contest I'm using a 100-point grading scale so I'm not fined by the FBI- I mean Loann.
 
Stage Quality: 50/100
This score will be based on how much I enjoyed playing the stage. Factors such as length and difficulty may be involved. Aesthetics are not going to be a positive factor, but aesthetic choices can make the meat of the gameplay (avoid bullet) less enjoyable, so they may still be a negative factor. I will leave specific comments on things that I thought were particularly good or bad for the experience. 

(Mid)Boss Quality: 50/100
 
This category has to deal with the (mid)boss quality - pretty much solely based on the patterns they have. In other words, it's their Danmaku Quality. I will talk about each pattern, give it a score out of 10, average that up and multiply by 5 to get this category's score.

Danmaku Quality encompasses the quality of the danmaku in your script. "Good" patterns will equal a "good" score in this category. What makes a pattern good is subjective, but the #1 factor is fun. A flashy, gorgeous pattern that isn't fun won't fare well here. Note that aesthetic factors can still factor into this - proper usage of sound effects and graphics can make an unfair pattern fair, and improper usage of those can make an otherwise-fair pattern unfair.

An "average" pattern is a 5. You can gain or lose points and I'll tell you why. If you get a bunch of 5s, that's not necessarily a bad thing!


that's it for categories lol

What is this?

Anyway to judge this seriously, the pre-midboss section is certainly Wacky and Zany. Having residual superdyings after you die is probably not a good idea since it contributes to death spirals. The Star Sparks:tm: or whatever look hideous, which is probably the intent, but it also makes it not so clear what the hitbox is (and they are faaaast).

Spears that stick into the screen edges are a pain but make some sense at least. Why is Avril Lavigne here. 

Anyway a lot of it is nonsense. Funny nonsense, but untelegraphed difficult nonsense nonetheless. 18/50.

Midboss Spell 1: most glorious whatsit :(. Anyway, the white square being safety isn't the most intuitive and it IS just spinning. Kinda pretty, but It's Spinning. 4/10.

Midboss Spell 2: Dodgeable! And keeps you moving, though it's still kind of plain. The ending is certainly a thing. 5.5/10.

Midboss Spell 3: Singlehandedly increased contest judging by 2 months. Anyway, I'll be nice and assume all the dead time is part of the FUN! In which case it's strangely easy compared to everything else and you get 4/10.

Boss Nonspell 1: Oh my god a pattern that's serious for real for real. Good, I like this one. Maybe a little on the hard side. 7/10.

Boss Spell 1: Spinnnn and then you don't need to spin anymore. I think it's pretty good, though I'd appreciate more structure near the end. 6.5/10.

Boss Nonspell 2: Similar thoughts as the last one, though it felt a bit easier to me. These are good nons. 7.25/10.

Boss Spell 2: Ikaruga spells aren't ones I tend to like, but this one explains it clearly and starts with something simple enough. If the phase with the green kunai wasn't so random I'd appreciate this one a good bit more. 5.5/10.

Boss Spell 3: This one feels like it could've been two separate spellcards - NotHouraiElixir and the last bit with the burst mechanic. Instead they got combined into one pattern, and I like the last one more than Hourai-Elixir-But-You-Stay-At-The-Bottom. I'll average them out to Fine and give it 5/10.
