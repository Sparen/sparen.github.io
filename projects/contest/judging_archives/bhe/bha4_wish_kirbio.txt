Wish's BHA4 Judging - Unworldly Manifestations
-=Kirbio's Entry=-
 
Rubric:
-20 points per pattern - 10 points to creativity and pattern aesthetics, 10 points to fun factor and pattern design.
-30 points towards general aesthetics, sound, and polish.  (For the record, *average* aesthetics is essentially the defaults per engine, and is at around a 6/10 per category)
-(Usual contest-specific bonuses will be omitted due to contest theme being OCs lol)
At the end, the total points will be divided by the total possible points, and then multiplied by <contest average> to get your final score.

Fair warning: I personally feel much better about several of these attacks, but I'm actively trying to not be blinded by bias :sweat_smile:

Nonspell 1: 12.5/20
LINE PIECE!!
Honestly not a crazy non altogether, but it's serviceable for the first non.
I like how the I pieces explode though.
6.5/10 - Creativity/Aesthetics, 6/10 - Fun/Design

Glitch Sign "Illusionary Blockage": 17.5/20
I can't play this card without giggling at it, it's hysterical
Dodging it is reasonably fair, not overwhelming, but not too much either as long as you use the focus button sometimes.
Yeah sorry I'm gonna have to take off the "no bias" cap for this one, it's too funny.  Perfect Creativity score.
10/10 - Creativity/Aesthetics, 7.5/10 - Fun/Design

Nonspell 2: 14.5/20
Once again pretty basic, but I like dodging it much better than the first non.
6.5/10 - Creativity/Aesthetics, 8/10 - Fun/Design

Hologram "Imaginary Weapon with No Name": 15/20
Really cool flair, slow and methodical (and also slightly boring) dodging
9/10 - Creativity/Aesthetics, 6/10 - Fun/Design

Nonspell 3: 15.5/20
Definitely the most unique non so far with the toughest dodging too.
7.5/10 - Creativity/Aesthetics, 8/10 - Fun/Design

Cognitohazard "Information Overload": 17/20
Haha funny Deltarune reference, but honestly it is genuinely more interesting to dodge than the original.
The little green bits are crazy threatening and it forces you to move around quite a bit.
8/10 - Creativity/Aesthetics, 9/10 - Fun/Design

Nonspell 4: 17.5/20
Creative use of the O piece (that doesn't look like an O due to Tetris but you brought it full circle) but not very impactful lol
This feels like Stage 3-Water of GoDS with the orb section replaced with T pieces but that's just fine
Your stages tend to feel like bosses...which they really shouldn't but that's a discussion for another day.  Nevertheless good
8.5/10 - Creativity/Aesthetics, 9/10 - Fun/Design

Fear "Claustrophobic Invaders": 18/20
I love the glowy bullets that use the same effect as the Space Invaders and this whole spell honestly looks fantastic
Dodging it has me move around decently and is quite fun!
9/10 - Creativity/Aesthetics, 9/10 - Fun/Design

wake up.
Anyway, the ULTIMATE SUPER CARD has been omitted, it's going to be impossible to judge.  Don't worry however, I'll be mentioning it in the aesthetic section.
 
AESTHETIC: 30/30
This section is going to be incredibly personal to me, and thusly I'm going to give a perfect aesthetic score here.
There's a problem with judging this script "objectively" and in context of a danmaku attack and not an experience - this script is *so* magical.
For me, in particular, this is a script literally featuring a bunch of my friends.  I can't *not* gush about it a little.
Miransu's "last hurrah" of a Fox Fire arrange is something I hum literally every time I play it and the sound effects are well chosen.
The aesthetics are really good in general and I think that goes without saying.  The polish on this script is even higher than usual for TAE internal stuff.
The card system is practically ripped from LCM and that is 100% fine because it works amazingly.  You even have Berserker Soul at the end with an absurdly insane finale.
Let's see if we can sum up all of them in one word:

GCP: EVAC!!
Mana: LMAO
Robin: bnuuy
Gilde: MegamanOmega
Tokiko: birb
KSK: fiery
Python: mitsuru?
Lunarethic: circle
Meowstic: catto
EDIT: AAAAA THIS ISN'T NEARLY ALL OF THEM SKJGBNSKLGN I JUST WENT BACK TO MY VOD I'M SORRY.......

Yeah never mind that was more boring than I expected.
ANYWAY y'all this script goes down as one of my favorites, maybe not for its overall objective quality, but for the STRONG impression it immediately left on my mind
And the thing is, it IS really good!!  It's not exactly easy to judge patterns in a vacuum so I'm sure I under or over scored some patterns throughout the process, and this goes for any script.
Anyway I loved it.
 
SUM OF PATTERNS: 127.5/160
AESTHETIC: 30/30
TOTAL: 157.5/190 * 25 = 20.72/25
