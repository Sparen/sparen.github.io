Bullet Hell Artistry #3 - Tsuzyx
For this contest I'm using a 25 point rating scale so I don't get fined.
 
Danmaku Quality: 15/25
 
Danmaku Quality encompasses the quality of the danmaku in your script. "Good" patterns will equal a "good" score in this category. What makes a pattern good is subjective, but the #1 factor is fun. A flashy, gorgeous pattern that isn't fun won't fare well here. Note that aesthetic factors can still factor into this - proper usage of sound effects and graphics can make an unfair pattern fair, and improper usage of those can make an otherwise-fair pattern unfair.

To be more clear, an "average" pattern is a 5. You can gain or lose points and I'll probably tell you why.
 
Individual patterns will be rated out of 10. The average of that will be taken and scaled to calculate the Danmaku Quality score.
 
Aesthetics: 5/25
 
This category encompasses how your entry looks (and sounds). While danmaku should absolutely come first, visual and audio elements are also a part of the gameplay experience.
 
Final Boss-ness: 5/25
 
5 points will be dedicated to how well the character feels transformed into a final boss. It's a judgment of how their themes translate into a more "serious" fight. Mostly subjective, but I'll try to give detail about why I rated something highly/lowly in this category. 
======================================================================================================================

Attack 1: Basic spiral. Pretty below average. 3/10.

Attack 2: This is a more interesting pattern at the very least? 4/10.

Attack 3: Unfortunately this attack seems pretty boring, even when compared to the previous ones. 2.5/10.

Attack 4: The abrupt transformation into downward bullets isn't good, and then the pattern is simple streaming. 2/10.

Attack 5: Due to the static angles it's very easy to find a safespot and just sit there. Kind of neat idea if it wasn't for that, I suppose, but it's just...boring. 3/10.

Attack 6: This one is lacking actual dodging. Just chill under the boss, slightly offset. 1.5/10.

Attack 7: These bullets are a PAIN to see. 2/10.

Attack 8: nonexistent :( there's a minimum rip. 0/10.

Danmaku Score: 2.25/10 (scaled to 3.375/15)
======================================================================================================================
 
Aesthetically, the lack of sounds and general jankiness is off-putting. 1.5/5.
======================================================================================================================
 
Doesn't really feel like a final boss at all. I guess it's more of a tech demo, but bullets being able to hit you would be a start. 0/5
 
OVERALL SCORE 3.375 + 1.5 + 0 = 4.875/25
