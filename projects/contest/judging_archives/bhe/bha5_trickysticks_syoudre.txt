Bullet Hell Artistry #5 - Syoudre
For this contest I'm using a 25 point rating scale because I feel like it.
 
Danmaku Quality: 15/25
 
Danmaku Quality encompasses the quality of the danmaku in your script. "Good" patterns will equal a "good" score in this category. What makes a pattern good is subjective, but the #1 factor is fun. A flashy, gorgeous pattern that isn't fun won't fare well here. Note that aesthetic factors can still factor into this - proper usage of sound effects and graphics can make an unfair pattern fair, and improper usage of those can make an otherwise-fair pattern unfair.

To be more clear, an "average" pattern is a 5. You can gain or lose points and I'll probably tell you why.
 
Individual patterns will be rated out of 10. The average of that will be taken and scaled to calculate the Danmaku Quality score.
 
Aesthetics: 5/25
 
This category encompasses how your entry looks (and sounds). While danmaku should absolutely come first, visual and audio elements are also a part of the gameplay experience. A high score in this category comes from your script being aesthetically appealing without being distracting.
 
Adherence to Contest Theme: 5/25
 
5 points will be dedicated to judging your choice of character and their danmaku. A high score in this category means you did a good job of integrating a character from another franchise into Touhou, and it means that both of your characters' danmaku works well together.

Played on Hard Mode (and Contest Mode) because I'm a pro gamer uwu

Nonspell 1: A good start to the script. Certainly an appropriate pattern for each of them, and the straight-lines of green bullets that Rumia shoots complements the fireballs pretty well. The rainbow spreads she shoots are less interesting, but it's still overall good. 7/10.

Spell 1: The pattern's also fairly good. I think this one drags on a little (maybe I'm supposed to change shottypes from Sanae?) but it's still fun to dodge. 6.75/10.

Nonspell 2: Aaaaaa curvy lasers aaaaaa. Rumia doesn't shoot a lot in this nonspell - and while I think it's justified for the pattern to be less dense (because CURVY LASERS) I think you might've taken it too far and made her contribution barely anything. Pattern's not bad though. 6.5/10.

Spell 2: This spell seems to be both a good bit harder than anything else in the script, AND it seems to have a way longer healthbar. It's a lot of random rain so I feel like Mr. Widefurry dominates this pattern too. Rumia's darkness didn't seem very relevant because the bullets rendered above it. Overall, I think these flaws render the pattern itself below average. 4/10.

Nonspell 3: Now it feels like Rumia does the heavy lifting and darkness furry man provides the gimmick. I like this one. 8/10.

Spell 3: Ooh, fancy intro. I for one tend to like modular spells if the parts of it blend together in interesting ways. This one is...alright, I guess? It seems to drag on for a while, much like the second spell, and I don't think the five circles necessarily blend together particularly well. It ends up feeling like dodging a bunch of spam from all sides to me. Props for the declaration though. 5/10. 

Danmaku Score: 6.20833333333333333333/10 (scaled to 9.3125/15)
======================================================================================================================
 
Aesthetically this script is...fine? I think the game just feels SMALL - tiny player relative to the playing field, and then you dodge a bunch of similarly tiny fireballs. The music not really starting until the first spell is neat but also confused me a bit at first, but maybe it's just my terrible hearing. Overall I'll put this at an above-average 3/5.
======================================================================================================================
 
I think the characters work together decently well. Spell 2 seems like the most egregious example of one character doing the majority of the work, but otherwise it's solidly above average. 3.5/5.
 
OVERALL SCORE 9.3125 + 3 + 3.5 = 15.8125/25
