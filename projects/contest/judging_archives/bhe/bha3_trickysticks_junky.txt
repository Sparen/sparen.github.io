Bullet Hell Artistry #3 - Junky
For this contest I'm using a 25 point rating scale so I don't get fined.
 
Danmaku Quality: 15/25
 
Danmaku Quality encompasses the quality of the danmaku in your script. "Good" patterns will equal a "good" score in this category. What makes a pattern good is subjective, but the #1 factor is fun. A flashy, gorgeous pattern that isn't fun won't fare well here. Note that aesthetic factors can still factor into this - proper usage of sound effects and graphics can make an unfair pattern fair, and improper usage of those can make an otherwise-fair pattern unfair.

To be more clear, an "average" pattern is a 5. You can gain or lose points and I'll probably tell you why.
 
Individual patterns will be rated out of 10. The average of that will be taken and scaled to calculate the Danmaku Quality score.
 
Aesthetics: 5/25
 
This category encompasses how your entry looks (and sounds). While danmaku should absolutely come first, visual and audio elements are also a part of the gameplay experience.
 
Final Boss-ness: 5/25
 
5 points will be dedicated to how well the character feels transformed into a final boss. It's a judgment of how their themes translate into a more "serious" fight. Mostly subjective, but I'll try to give detail about why I rated something highly/lowly in this category.

Nonspell 1: I think this nonspell is a good start. Clear Nitori inspiration while also being fun to dodge. 8.5/10.

Spell 1: I usually really dislike spells like this, but the implementation of this gimmick is actually pretty fun. You don't just insta-die if you leave a ring for a second or two and the dodging while within them is pretty fun. Good work. 9/10.

Nonspell 2: She has a WHAT in the background now? Pretty interesting; I adore the aesthetics but I actually like the previous non a little more in terms of dodging. 8.25/10.

Spell 2: This spellcard has enough fun elements packed into it that I honestly forgot it was just ONE attack. Wonderful. 9.5/10.

Nonspell 3: Cool! I found it pretty easy to misjudge the hitbox of the Laser Thingy but that isn't a large flaw. 8.25/10.

Spell 3: A good survival card that doesn't overstay its welcome. 8.5/10.

Nonspell 4: I think this non's still good, just doesn't stand out too much. 8/10.

Nonspell 5: Maybe the previous non didn't stand out because this one does? It's quite flashy and fun to dodge. 8.5/10.

Spell 4: The warning lasers are very good design. Fun, fair, and it's kind of cool to dodge with those special warnings. 8.75/10.

Spell 5: An excellent way to end the script. Ramps up in difficulty appropriately and never feels unfair. Very good. 9.25/10.

Danmaku Score: 8.65/10 (scaled to 12.975/15)
======================================================================================================================
 
Aesthetically, I'd say this script is amazing. I admit it's kind of odd to see Touhou in a style with explosions and a giant 3D weapon in the background, but it's still excellent. 4/5.
======================================================================================================================
 
I'd say this feels very much like a final boss. There's a lot of dramatic explosions and the like, a survival spell and the usual ramping final attack. Excellent here too. 4.25/5
 
OVERALL SCORE 12.975 + 4 + 4.25 = 21.225/25
