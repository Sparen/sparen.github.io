Bullet Hell Artistry #3 - Kudo
For this contest I'm using a 25 point rating scale so I don't get fined.
 
Danmaku Quality: 15/25
 
Danmaku Quality encompasses the quality of the danmaku in your script. "Good" patterns will equal a "good" score in this category. What makes a pattern good is subjective, but the #1 factor is fun. A flashy, gorgeous pattern that isn't fun won't fare well here. Note that aesthetic factors can still factor into this - proper usage of sound effects and graphics can make an unfair pattern fair, and improper usage of those can make an otherwise-fair pattern unfair.

To be more clear, an "average" pattern is a 5. You can gain or lose points and I'll probably tell you why.
 
Individual patterns will be rated out of 10. The average of that will be taken and scaled to calculate the Danmaku Quality score.
 
Aesthetics: 5/25
 
This category encompasses how your entry looks (and sounds). While danmaku should absolutely come first, visual and audio elements are also a part of the gameplay experience.
 
Final Boss-ness: 5/25
 
5 points will be dedicated to how well the character feels transformed into a final boss. It's a judgment of how their themes translate into a more "serious" fight. Mostly subjective, but I'll try to give detail about why I rated something highly/lowly in this category. 
======================================================================================================================

Nonspell 1: Pretty typical Nazrin non. Not very interesting, lasts too long. 5/10.

Spell 1: Seems pretty reasonable; quite slow and you should just stay in the middle. 6/10.

Nonspell 2: I feel like the bullets are painfully slow in this non. Still not offensive or anything; but kind of eh. 5.5/10.

Spell 2: Not too interesting but not offensive. I think a bullet spawned on top of me once? 5.5/10.

Nonspell 3: More interesting than the first two nons, good work! Her random movement could be kind of annoying but it's nice. 6/10.

Spell 3: Seems thoroughly fine. Not a very interesting use of the gimmick. 6/10.

Nonspell 4: Fairly interesting too; maybe a little less so than the previous non. 6/10.

Spell 4: The laser that looks like it could kill you should probably be transparent or otherwise indicate that it won't kill you. I think the idea is kind of fine, but the implementation is boring. There are other ways to make a survival besides turning off player shots. 4.5/10.

Danmaku Score: 5.56/10 (scaled to 8.34/15)
======================================================================================================================
 
Aesthetically, I'd say this script is below average. Non-looping music leaving you with nothing to listen to, the patterns aren't really aesthetically pleasant, the backgrounds are super boring. 1.75/5.
======================================================================================================================
 
I think the script's final boss-ness is subpar. 2/5.
 
OVERALL SCORE 8.34 + 1.75 + 2 = 12.09/25
