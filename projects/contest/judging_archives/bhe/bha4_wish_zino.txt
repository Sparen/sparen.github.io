Wish's BHA4 Judging - Unworldly Manifestations
-=Zino's Entry=-
 
Rubric:
-20 points per pattern - 10 points to creativity and pattern aesthetics, 10 points to fun factor and pattern design.
-30 points towards general aesthetics, sound, and polish.  (For the record, *average* aesthetics is essentially the defaults per engine, and is at around a 6/10 per category)
-(Usual contest-specific bonuses will be omitted due to contest theme being OCs lol)
At the end, the total points will be divided by the total possible points, and then multiplied by <contest average> to get your final score.
 
Nonspell 1: 13/20
Basic, pretty enough, fun to dodge, passable.  Wish it had more variety.
6.5/10 - Creativity/Aesthetics, 6.5/10 - Fun/Design

Pagoda Art -S.H.O.U.- Tundra Tornado PH: 8.5/20
Speeeeeen.  It looks pretty enough but it's boring.
6.5/10 - Creativity/Aesthetics, 2/10 - Fun/Design

Nonspell 2: 13.5/20
Similar critiques to nonspell 1, but better looks.  Still wish it had more variety
7/10 - Creativity/Aesthetics, 6.5/10 - Fun/Design
 
Conversation Sign -F.A.E.B.- Ice Breaker: 14.5/20
Simple concept, neat indicators, keeps me moving around, pretty nice.  Just wish it had more impact with sfx.
7.5/10 - Creativity/Aesthetics, 7/10 - Fun/Design

Nonspell 3: 14/20
You know what, it technically looks more basic compared to Non 2, but I like this a million times more
It's clean, the big-ass micro squares have impact, it's more fun to dodge, yes.
6.5/10 - Creativity/Aesthetics, 7.5/10 - Fun/Design

Cry of the Trapped Bird - SnowGrave -F.A.T.A.L.-: 19/20
Obvious reference, RIP Berdly.
Memeing aside, this spell is actually pretty cool.  It keeps me moving and looks beautiful, gets really intense towards the end.
One of the most memorable spells in the competition, unironically.
10/10 - Creativity/Aesthetics, 9/10 - Fun/Design

Nonspell 4: 12/20
Wait there's stuff after this?  Uh
A more boring version of nonspell 3, but otherwise fine.  Nothing particularly bad about it.
6/10 - Creativity/Aesthetics, 6/10 - Fun/Design

Thrill Wheel -R.I.T.A. S.P.- Graze 500,621 bullets to win!: 8/20
What the hell am I looking at.
I mean the attack is fine and it's a fascinating clear condition but...it feels weird.  I don't really like it lmao
5/10 - Creativity/Aesthetics, 3/10 - Fun/Design
 
AESTHETIC: 21/30
Looks: Solid looking script visually, besides fighting Nueball. 8/10
Sound: I actually had a weird music bug happening when deathbombing during judging, wtf.  -1 for that
Otherwise lol Sentence of Death never dies and sfx are fine. 6/10
Polish: Why did you make your fursona's tail swish and why did that take so much of your time. 7/10
 
SUM OF PATTERNS: 102.5/160
AESTHETIC: 21/30
TOTAL: 123.5/190 * 25 = 16.25/25

Frankly I can't tell how much of this script was a shitpost and how much of it was serious...it was certainly interesting, but not my favorite of yours lol.
Nice work having an insanely memorable (and faithful) SnowGrave tribute, though, it was honestly the standout moment.
