Bullet Hell Artistry #3 - Zino & Rak
For this contest I'm using a 25 point rating scale so I don't get fined.
 
Danmaku Quality: 15/25
 
Danmaku Quality encompasses the quality of the danmaku in your script. "Good" patterns will equal a "good" score in this category. What makes a pattern good is subjective, but the #1 factor is fun. A flashy, gorgeous pattern that isn't fun won't fare well here. Note that aesthetic factors can still factor into this - proper usage of sound effects and graphics can make an unfair pattern fair, and improper usage of those can make an otherwise-fair pattern unfair.

To be more clear, an "average" pattern is a 5. You can gain or lose points and I'll probably tell you why.
 
Individual patterns will be rated out of 10. The average of that will be taken and scaled to calculate the Danmaku Quality score.
 
Aesthetics: 5/25
 
This category encompasses how your entry looks (and sounds). While danmaku should absolutely come first, visual and audio elements are also a part of the gameplay experience.
 
Final Boss-ness: 5/25
 
5 points will be dedicated to how well the character feels transformed into a final boss. It's a judgment of how their themes translate into a more "serious" fight. Mostly subjective, but I'll try to give detail about why I rated something highly/lowly in this category. 
======================================================================================================================

Nonspell 1: Solid opener. Rather unfortunate that it effortlessly dies before the second part can happen, but I find that part to be prettier/even more interesting than what you actually have to dodge. 7.5/10.

Spell 1: Streaming through some junk, yay. Also dies really fast I think, but a fine pattern nonetheless. 7/10.

Nonspell 2: Another streaming pattern so soon after the first...but I'd say it's different enough to be fine. Less interesting than the first non though. I'd say it's about the same as the previous spell. 7/10.

Spell 2: Now this is what I'd call a good pattern. The lasers are aimed, but misdirecting it well to maximize the time you have for dealing damage is fun. Nice work. 8.75/10.

Alice 2 Shows Up: wtf/10

Nonspell 3: Now this is an interesting non. Not really sure how to optimally do this, but there DOES seem to be a lot of room for optimization. The dolls can be shot down, you can direct them in certain ways...excellent. 8.5/10.

Spell 3: I actually had a decent amount of trouble killing this one before the timer went out before I actually practiced it and changed my strategy. I think this pattern's pretty good too. Not as good as the last non, but solid overall. 7.5/10. 

Spell 4: Now this is a pattern I just...really don't get. I've worked out a strategy that takes a while but can capture this, but I'm probably just not really understanding how the aimed stuff bounces off the bottom. Are they reflecting at the targeted area or something? Besides the esoterics I'd say this is fine. 6.75/10.

Spell 5: After a few plays I noticed the gimmick of dolls deleting bullets of the same color, but I ultimately just settled on kind of hanging near the bottom and dodging like a madman. That's what I first did before noticing the gimmick. Doing it this way means the lasers aren't threatening at all besides the screen shaking (which I promptly turned down). Overall kind of a strange pattern. Not sure how it's intended to be done, but my method works out well enough with some tricky dodges. 6.75/10.

Danmaku Score: 7.469/10 (scaled to 11.20/15)
======================================================================================================================
 
Aesthetically, I think this is a very interesting style. The graphics and sounds follow the pixel-y theme without hampering gameplay. Wonderful work. 4.5/5.
======================================================================================================================
 
I think the abrupt transition is kind of jarring for a final boss, and ending on a survival seemed kind of lame. It doesn't really "feel" a ton like a final boss. I think it's about average. Maybe a bit below average. 2.25/5
 
OVERALL SCORE 11.20 + 4.5 + 2.25 = 17.95/25
