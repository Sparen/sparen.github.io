Wish's BHA4 Judging - Unworldly Manifestations
-=Pickled Cow's Entry=-
 
Rubric:
-20 points per pattern - 10 points to creativity and pattern aesthetics, 10 points to fun factor and pattern design.
-30 points towards general aesthetics, sound, and polish.  (For the record, *average* aesthetics is essentially the defaults per engine, and is at around a 6/10 per category)
-(Usual contest-specific bonuses will be omitted due to contest theme being OCs lol)
At the end, the total points will be divided by the total possible points, and then multiplied by <contest average> to get your final score.

This is one of the most cursed screenshots I've ever seen.

Nonspell 1: 12/20
Basic crisscrossing non, ok.
Worth reporting fairly consistent flickering on this non.
6/10 - Creativity/Aesthetics, 6/10 - Fun/Design

Gherkin "Pickle Leviathan": 9/20
Hi Nitori Cucumber With Curving Lasers
It's pretty basic.  Still some flickering.
4/10 - Creativity/Aesthetics, 5/10 - Fun/Design

Nonspell 2: 14/20
More interesting than the previous one (with more flickering), pretty decent.
7/10 - Creativity/Aesthetics, 7/10 - Fun/Design

Picklemancy "Curse of the Pickle Jar": 12/20
Standard, *very basic*, but somewhat effective.  I feel like mechanically the bullet graphic morph doesn't do very much, but it looks nice.
Aesthetics are majorly carrying this attack, though.
7/10 - Creativity/Aesthetics, 5/10 - Fun/Design

Nonspell 3: 12/20
Rotating BoWaP on an ellipse.
Again, mega basic, but at least it looks pretty and dodging it isn't braindead.
Much less flickering on this non, but it happened to the items.
6/10 - Creativity/Aesthetics, 6/10 - Fun/Design

Pickle Sign "Cucumber Fermentation": 5/20
This attack really lacks impact with sfx and I have absolutely no idea how you dodge it.
Little aesthetics to carry it either, it's pretty boring.
3/10 - Creativity/Aesthetics, 2/10 - Fun/Design

Nonspell 4: 6/20
Urumi non, next.
3/10 - Creativity/Aesthetics, 3/10 - Fun/Design

Cow Grinder 6000: 10/20
This is...extremely dark for an otherwise tongue-in-cheek script, wtf
Otherwise it's pretty boring.  But the aesthetics and theming left an impression.
6/10 - Creativity/Aesthetics, 4/10 - Fun/Design

Bovine Disaster "Corrupted Milk": 11/20
If your cow is making radioactive fireballs you might want to take them to a vet.
Say it with me now: "basic"! But the theming is pretty neat and the milk filling up the stg frame is neat.
7/10 - Creativity/Aesthetics, 4/10 - Fun/Design

"Pickle Dimensions": 15/20
I think that's the first time I've seen a custom 3D background for *one spell* before.  Reminds me a lot of Stage 7 in Gouyoku Ibun, but green.
Besides that this is honestly my favorite attack of the bunch.  A serviceable final spell that's actually quite interesting to dodge, I'm impressed.
7/10 - Creativity/Aesthetics, 8/10 - Fun/Design

AESTHETIC: 26/30
Looks: I know it's not a fair fight when you consider the other scripts are LuaSTG and DNH but wow this is honestly staggering.  The flickering can be forgiven because everything else is so CLEAN. 10/10
Sound: Pretty basic sound usage for a custom engine, and I think it's mostly ZUN sfx.  Decent music.  Average.  6/10
Polish: Lmao why the [expletive] does this script have unusuals, I love it.  I really like how the background is so dynamic, too.
Otherwise this is an extremely solid showing of your engine and its capabilities and I hope it's decent to use. 10/10
 
SUM OF PATTERNS: 106/200
AESTHETIC: 26/30
TOTAL: 132/230 * 25 = 14.35/25

It's a mostly average script that's really carried by its engine and potential, but I think that's the point.
The script isn't super special, but as a tech demo it's VERY promising and I'm curious to see what comes of it.
