Bullet Hell Artistry #3 - Syoudre
For this contest I'm using a 25 point rating scale so I don't get fined.
 
Danmaku Quality: 15/25
 
Danmaku Quality encompasses the quality of the danmaku in your script. "Good" patterns will equal a "good" score in this category. What makes a pattern good is subjective, but the #1 factor is fun. A flashy, gorgeous pattern that isn't fun won't fare well here. Note that aesthetic factors can still factor into this - proper usage of sound effects and graphics can make an unfair pattern fair, and improper usage of those can make an otherwise-fair pattern unfair.

To be more clear, an "average" pattern is a 5. You can gain or lose points and I'll probably tell you why.
 
Individual patterns will be rated out of 10. The average of that will be taken and scaled to calculate the Danmaku Quality score.
 
Aesthetics: 5/25
 
This category encompasses how your entry looks (and sounds). While danmaku should absolutely come first, visual and audio elements are also a part of the gameplay experience.
 
Final Boss-ness: 5/25
 
5 points will be dedicated to how well the character feels transformed into a final boss. It's a judgment of how their themes translate into a more "serious" fight. Mostly subjective, but I'll try to give detail about why I rated something highly/lowly in this category. 
======================================================================================================================

Played on Normal Mode.

Nonspell 1: Not super interesting. Bouncing balls. A bit above average. 5.25/10.

Spell 1: Seems quite a bit harder than the nonspell before you realize you can shoot down the oranges. I like it, but it feels like almost half a difficulty above the previous. 6/10.

Nonspell 2: Also fine. Angular velocity thingies, not super interesting but above average. 5.25/10.

Spell 2: Bouncing balls with aimed thingies? I like this better than the previous patterns.  6.25/10.

Nonspell 3: BoWaP in disguise?! Anyway it's better than the last two nons. 5.5/10.

Spell 3: Dodging angular velocity in a confined space. Not super interesting unfortunately, but it's fine. 5.5/10.

Nonspell 4: This is way harder than the other patterns, I feel. Not too hard for me, but probably too much compared to previous patterns. 4/10.

Spell 4: It's an acceptable survival. Not super interesting, but not offensive. 5/10.

Spell 5: Multi-phase script ender. The first phase is kind of pointless in my opinion, since it's super easy and only gets easier when you shoot down the oranges. 5.25/10.

Danmaku Score: 5.33/10 (scaled to 8/15)
======================================================================================================================
 
Aesthetically, I'd say this script is a bit below average. The realistic oranges are pretty weird and I feel like the graphics clash a lot. 2/5.
======================================================================================================================
 
I think this script's final boss-ness is below average. Most patterns aren't very flashy/bombastic/fitting for a final boss. 1.5/5

Also do note that you can easily cause an error by trying to use C to immediately skip dialogue at the beginning.
 
OVERALL SCORE 8 + 2 + 1.5 = 11.5/25
