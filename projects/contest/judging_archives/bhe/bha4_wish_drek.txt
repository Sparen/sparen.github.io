Wish's BHA4 Judging - Unworldly Manifestations
-=Drek's Entry=-
 
Rubric:
-20 points per pattern - 10 points to creativity and pattern aesthetics, 10 points to fun factor and pattern design.
-30 points towards general aesthetics, sound, and polish.  (For the record, *average* aesthetics is essentially the defaults per engine, and is at around a 6/10 per category)
-(Usual contest-specific bonuses will be omitted due to contest theme being OCs lol)
At the end, the total points will be divided by the total possible points, and then multiplied by <contest average> to get your final score.

Non 1: 16/20
Pattern is relatively standard but it's fun and cool.  Lol Sine Wave.  It's fun and that's good enough for me
8/10 - Creativity/Aesthetics, 8/10 - Fun/Design

Water Sign "Inhabited Geyser": 15/20
The use of the Minecraft sprites throughout this script is pretty hilarious and it looks cool.  It's WAY too fast and a bit hard to learn how it even works.
The huge splash of glowy orbs even when you *do* dodge the fish is just so much.  You can misdirect it but it's a bit goofy due to the bobber.
Second wave is better in difficulty but a bit more basic to dodge.  A good breather but could be better
9.5/10 - Creativity/Aesthetics, 5.5/10 - Fun/Design

Non 2: 16/20
Pretty basic to dodge compared to the first non, but a heavy graphical upgrade.  Overall about on par.
I really like how the sword v-shape cloud of bullets looks.
9/10 - Creativity/Aesthetics, 7/10 - Fun/Design

Icy Breeze "Tempest in a Box": 16/20
Those delay lasers look SEXY and the rest of the pattern isn't...too crazy.  
The gravity is pretty annoying and can lead to some weird situations, but I probably could be playing around it better.
9.5/10 - Creativity/Aesthetics, 6.5/10 - Fun/Design

Non 3: 16/20
Pretty basic dodging but I like how it keeps you constantly on your toes.
I'm not a super big fan of how the flower clumps look for some reason, but the squares of stars are a semi-neat aesthetic.
7.5/10 - Creativity/Aesthetics, 8.5/10 - Fun/Design

(-1 - additional penalty on Non 3 because it actively has bullet deletion issues!  they didn't all cancel before the next attack started.
it wasn't common but did happen while judging!!)

Last Rockabye "Resplendent Fulgor": 17/20
What on Earth is this spell name... this is Ryann tier.
I REALLY like the concept behind the first part of the attack but I think it's a bit too tough to read.
The second part is a pretty basic big burst of dense, slow bullets, but it looks neat.  I think it's my favorite so far.
8.5/10 - Creativity/Aesthetics, 8.5/10 - Fun/Design

Non 4: 12/20
I *really* am not a big fan of the dodging on this one.  First part is basic if you just move vertically, and the second part snipes me so often.
It looks decent but not super outstanding in comparison to the other patterns.
7/10 - Creativity/Aesthetics, 5/10 - Fun/Design

Demon & Demigod "Why Not?": 17/20
This attack is...a lot to take in!  It's really dense in variety, which is pretty impressive on its own
I think the attack is fun but pretty overwhelming to dodge.  It does seem like it'd be pretty fulfilling once it's learned, though
I like how it's a survival that doesn't overstay its welcome.  Short and sweet
8.5/10 - Creativity/Aesthetics, 8.5/10 - Fun/Design

One & Only "Into the New Heart": 16/20
The first part of it is a cool idea, but ultimately pretty basic to dodge.  It's ok, it's clean and looks cool
Second part of it is MUCH more fun, fast paced and keeps me on my toes.  I wish it was more of the attack
9/10 - Creativity/Aesthetics, 7/10 - Fun/Design

AESTHETIC: 21.5/30
Looks: Your package looks cool!  It's not the best one I've seen but it's pretty damn solid 7/10
Sound: Pretty standard for DNH and some sound effects are oddly quiet.  Good music choice though 6.5/10
Polish: The dialogue and SnY tie-in with Tricky WHM is pretty funny.  Using the Minecraft sprite motif throughout several attacks is an interesting choice but a nice polish detail.  Same with other effects 8/10

SUM OF PATTERNS: 124/180
AESTHETIC: 21.5/30
TOTAL: 145.5/210 * 25 = 17.3215
That was a fun script!  It was definitely too hard for me to regularly be able to dodge, but the pattern concepts were very good.
