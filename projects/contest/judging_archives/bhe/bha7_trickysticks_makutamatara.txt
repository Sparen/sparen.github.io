Bullet Hell Artistry #7 - makutamatara
For this contest I'm using a 25 point rating scale because I feel like it. It will be scaled to accommodate the other judges' scores if necessary. (It turns out this is necessary, so at the end your score is getting an awesome x4 multiplier!)
 
Danmaku Quality: 15/25
 
Danmaku Quality encompasses the quality of the danmaku in your script. "Good" patterns will equal a "good" score in this category. What makes a pattern good is subjective, but the #1 factor is fun. A flashy, gorgeous pattern that isn't fun won't fare well here. Note that aesthetic factors can still factor into this - proper usage of sound effects and graphics can make an unfair pattern fair, and improper usage of those can make an otherwise-fair pattern unfair. This may consider the contest gimmick as well (in this case, non-Touhou mechanics).

To be more clear, an "average" pattern is a 5. You can gain or lose points and I'll probably tell you why. If you get a bunch of 5s, that's not necessarily a bad thing!

If I rate individual patterns, they will be rated out of 10. The average of that will be taken and scaled to calculate the Danmaku Quality score. If I don't rate individual patterns, you'll just get a score out of 15.
 
Aesthetics: 5/25
 
This category encompasses how your entry looks (and sounds). While danmaku should absolutely come first, visual and audio elements are also a part of the gameplay experience. A high score in this category comes from your script being aesthetically appealing without being distracting. A low score in this category comes from annoying sounds, grating music, and visuals that make dodging more difficult.
 
Adherence to Contest Theme: 5/25
 
5 points will be dedicated to judging the contest theme - in which case, how well I think your patterns embody the idea of being "contradictory". Creativity is key - think outside the box as you strive to find unity in opposites.

Me pick Normal Mode.

Danmaku-wise, I thought the patterns were pretty fair. Mostly. Some of them are kind of nuts/will-kill-you-immediately like Marisa's rapid-fire spark, but...actually maybe it's just hers, for the bosses. The danmaku contained in other minigames was pretty fun and reasonable too. Marisa aaaa. 

Danmaku Score: 7.75/10 (scaled to 11.625/15)
==========================================================================================================================

I am not super familiar with WarioWare games so I won't compare it to the original - only internally. And, well, I think this script is pretty internally aesthetically consistent. I suppose it's not a very "fancy" game, but I don't think being fancy is the point (or that fancy is necessarily good). Quite nice. 3.75/5.

============================================================================================================================

I think you integrated minigames into Touhou about as well as one could expect, to be honest. It is jarring to face a game you haven't played before, especially if it makes you think fast...which might be the point, I think? At the same time it can be kind of lame to have a game that makes you think fast and die in the first second. Likely more of a thing I dislike about the genre than this implementation of it. I STILL don't think Marisa needs to do that >:(. Overall I do think you did a great job despite that. 4/5.

OVERALL SCORE 11.625 + 3.75 + 4 = 19.375/25 (multiplied by 4 to make this out of 100, so 77.5/100.)
