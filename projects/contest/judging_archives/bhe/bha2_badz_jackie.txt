Badz's BHA2 Judging: Ice and Fire by Jackie Matthews

The final score is out of 25, split as follows:

Gameplay: 15 points
How well the script plays. Each pattern is judged individually.
The individual scores are further split as 5/15 for concept and 10/15 for gameplay.

Creativity and theme: 5 points
How well the script uses the contest theme. Based on having a fitting pair of characters, and making good use of both of them.

Aesthetics and presentation: 5 points
How good the script looks and feels. Includes visuals, as well as other presentation aspects like sound effects and the system.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Creativity and theme: 4/5
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm not sure why those two are working together, but the fire-and-ice theme is exploited fairly well throughout the script.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Aesthetics and presentation: 3.5/5
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Everything looks acceptable. Bonus points for the custom title screen.
(I'm not a fan of the inescapable void that is the Options menu, though.)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gameplay: 9/15
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------
Pattern 1
8.5/15 (3/5 | 5.5/10)

It seems fine, but those amulets are entirely too dense for me to deal with.
The switch between the two segments of the patterns is also very abrupt, and there's little time to get out of the way from the aimed blast.

--------------------------------------------------
Pattern 2
9/15 (4/5 | 5/10)

I like the flow this pattern has when dodging.
Problem is, there's nothing to dodge between waves while Cirno sets up the ice wall.

--------------------------------------------------
Pattern 3
12.5/15 (4.5/5 | 8/10)

The mirror effect with the two characters' patterns is neat, and the phoenixes and ice dragons are beautiful. And it's fun to dodge!
Only thing I'd complain about is that, due to the wing flap effect, the macrododging attacks seem smaller when they spawn compared to when they reach the player.

--------------------------------------------------
Pattern 4
6.5/15 (2/5 | 4.5/10)

Noooooooo. I don't like having my vision obscured.
If you're going to do this, you should use predictable patterns that the player can still estimate while they're hidden. The fast-and-random blue scale waves are particularly problematic here.

--------------------------------------------------
Pattern 5
8.5/15 (2.5/5 | 6/10)

This seems to be a filler pattern, and it doesn't have any glaring flaws. Next one!

--------------------------------------------------
Pattern 6
9.5/15 (3.5/5 | 6/10)

The focus/unfocus gimmick is nice, though it could have used some kind of tell so the player knows it exists.
The side danmaku could have been more interesting, as well.

Final score: 16.5/25

Closing notes
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-This script was rushed, and it shows in quite a few places. But with some polish, I believe the concepts could really shine.
