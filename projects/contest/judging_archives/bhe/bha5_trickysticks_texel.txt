Bullet Hell Artistry #5 - Texel
For this contest I'm using a 25 point rating scale because I feel like it.
 
Danmaku Quality: 15/25
 
Danmaku Quality encompasses the quality of the danmaku in your script. "Good" patterns will equal a "good" score in this category. What makes a pattern good is subjective, but the #1 factor is fun. A flashy, gorgeous pattern that isn't fun won't fare well here. Note that aesthetic factors can still factor into this - proper usage of sound effects and graphics can make an unfair pattern fair, and improper usage of those can make an otherwise-fair pattern unfair.

To be more clear, an "average" pattern is a 5. You can gain or lose points and I'll probably tell you why.
 
Individual patterns will be rated out of 10. The average of that will be taken and scaled to calculate the Danmaku Quality score.
 
Aesthetics: 5/25
 
This category encompasses how your entry looks (and sounds). While danmaku should absolutely come first, visual and audio elements are also a part of the gameplay experience. A high score in this category comes from your script being aesthetically appealing without being distracting.
 
Adherence to Contest Theme: 5/25
 
5 points will be dedicated to judging your choice of character and their danmaku. A high score in this category means you did a good job of integrating a character from another franchise into Touhou, and it means that both of your characters' danmaku works well together.

Nonspell 1: It's fairly fine. Looking at the character I don't THINK it's super relevant to her, but it's not like Cirno shooting fireballs or anything. 6.5/10. 

Spell 1: Quite the fun one. 8/10.

Spell 2: Streaming while going through some easy stuff, woo. Fine. 7.25/10.

Spell 3: I'm not sure why either one of them is shooting hearts, but it's annoying streaming altogether. Restreaming is a pain. 4.75/10.

Spell 4: Hearts seem just as inappropriate, but the pattern's much nicer to dodge. 6.5/10.

Spell 5: Funny. The tiny dot bullets are utterly hellish to dodge though. Would be more fun and probably easier if they were bigger. 4.75/10. 

Danmaku Score: 6.2916/10 (scaled to 9.4375/15)
======================================================================================================================
 
Aesthetically I like what you're going for, but I dislike how it ended up in practice. The game window is tiny, bullet graphics are a pain to dodge at such a resolution, etc. I actively dislike this for danmaku - maybe it'd work for any other type of game where precise movements don't matter as much. 1.5/5.
======================================================================================================================
 
Character cooperation seems...below average, actually? Throwing Keine is funny, but otherwise they seem to be sharing the same pattern, which isn't usually relevant to Keine's character at all. 2/5.
 
OVERALL SCORE 9.4375 + 1.5 + 2 = 12.9375/25
