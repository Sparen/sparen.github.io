Bullet Hell Artistry #3 - Taizen
For this contest I'm using a 25 point rating scale so I don't get fined.
 
Danmaku Quality: 15/25
 
Danmaku Quality encompasses the quality of the danmaku in your script. "Good" patterns will equal a "good" score in this category. What makes a pattern good is subjective, but the #1 factor is fun. A flashy, gorgeous pattern that isn't fun won't fare well here. Note that aesthetic factors can still factor into this - proper usage of sound effects and graphics can make an unfair pattern fair, and improper usage of those can make an otherwise-fair pattern unfair.

To be more clear, an "average" pattern is a 5. You can gain or lose points and I'll probably tell you why.
 
Individual patterns will be rated out of 10. The average of that will be taken and scaled to calculate the Danmaku Quality score.
 
Aesthetics: 5/25
 
This category encompasses how your entry looks (and sounds). While danmaku should absolutely come first, visual and audio elements are also a part of the gameplay experience.
 
Final Boss-ness: 5/25
 
5 points will be dedicated to how well the character feels transformed into a final boss. It's a judgment of how their themes translate into a more "serious" fight. Mostly subjective, but I'll try to give detail about why I rated something highly/lowly in this category. 
======================================================================================================================

Nonspell 1: Not that hard, despite the phallic implications. I didn't get cocky here. 7.5/10.

Spell 1: Pretty good pattern here too. I dislike curving but this was manageable.  7.5/10.

Nonspell 2: A variant of the first non, and I like it about the same. 7.5/10.

Spell 2: Pretty easy until they become Double Hydangeas:tm:. I like this one, just not as much as previous patterns. 7/10.

Nonspell 3: I started this non with her low on the screen from the previous spell and that was kind of unfortunate. Other than that I quite like this non too. 6.75/10.

Spell 3: I was going to complain about the staticness:tm: of this, but then she added another layer to the pattern and started moving. I like the use of movement here! 8.5/10.

Nonspell 4: D O U B L E  B O W A P. I like this too. Felt a bit short compared to the other nons but maybe I was just good at staying under her. 7.5/10.

Spell 4: I generally don't like patterns like this much, but this one was pretty decent. 6.5/10.

Spell 5: I was a little worried I'd have to dodge the white ones too, but I'm quite happy I didn't have to. It got dicey near the end but I somehow capped it. Good. 8/10.

Spell 6: I think one ramps a bit too slowly - it's really easy until near the very end. I quite like the idea though. 6.5/10.

Danmaku Score: 7.325/10 (scaled to 10.99/15)
======================================================================================================================
 
Aesthetically, I'd say this script is pretty good. I like the pixel-y aesthetic. 4/5.
======================================================================================================================
 
I think this script's final boss-ness is above average. Nothing suuuper flashy but has a multi-phase ending thing. 3/5.
 
OVERALL SCORE 10.99 + 4 + 3 = 17.99/25
