Bullet Hell Artistry #3 - DoctorD
For this contest I'm using a 25 point rating scale so I don't get fined.
 
Danmaku Quality: 15/25
 
Danmaku Quality encompasses the quality of the danmaku in your script. "Good" patterns will equal a "good" score in this category. What makes a pattern good is subjective, but the #1 factor is fun. A flashy, gorgeous pattern that isn't fun won't fare well here. Note that aesthetic factors can still factor into this - proper usage of sound effects and graphics can make an unfair pattern fair, and improper usage of those can make an otherwise-fair pattern unfair.

To be more clear, an "average" pattern is a 5. You can gain or lose points and I'll probably tell you why.
 
Individual patterns will be rated out of 10. The average of that will be taken and scaled to calculate the Danmaku Quality score.
 
Aesthetics: 5/25
 
This category encompasses how your entry looks (and sounds). While danmaku should absolutely come first, visual and audio elements are also a part of the gameplay experience.
 
Final Boss-ness: 5/25
 
5 points will be dedicated to how well the character feels transformed into a final boss. It's a judgment of how their themes translate into a more "serious" fight. Mostly subjective, but I'll try to give detail about why I rated something highly/lowly in this category.

Played as Flandre.

The opening is weird.

Nonspell 1: This non is fine and why is she dancing. 6.5/10.

Spell 1: Very slow to start but the pattern is...fine? Why is there a random jumpscare. 6/10.

Nonspell 2: Timed this one out. The pattern is fine but she goes around all over the place. 5.5/10.

Spell 2: It's...fine? I don't like it very much but it's not super bad or anything. 6/10.

Nonspell 3: Pretty solid pattern. 7/10.

Spell 3: Also pretty solid. I think the stopping bullets are pretty abrupt, but it's a neat idea! 7/10.

Nonspell 4: Also a solid pattern. I admit I don't have a lot to say about these. 7/10.

Spell 4: Pretty solid survival, too. Maybe too sluggish to start? 6.75/10.

Nonspell 5: Aimed bullets from weird-ass places. Also fine! 7/10.

Spell 5: Why is the cutin that. Why are there teeth. The pattern is fine though! 7/10.

Spell 6: wtf. Anyway, the earlier lasers are so big they're kind of weird? But the last phase is quite interesting. 7/10.

Danmaku Score: 6.61/10 (scaled to 9.92/15)
======================================================================================================================
 
Aesthetically, I'd say this script is above average. Probably a solid 3.25/5 or so? But I hate, hate, hate jumpscares. Hate them enough to reduce your score to 1.5/5.
======================================================================================================================
 
I think the script's final boss-ness is...uh...too ridiculous to take seriously, so you also get a 1.5/5.
 
OVERALL SCORE 9.92 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 12.92/25
