----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Creativity and theme: 4/5
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Two flowery characters, and with danmaku that makes good use of both of them.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Aesthetics and presentation: 4.5/5
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Custom STG frame, CtC sprites, nice music, everything's there.

Gameplay: 12/15

--------------------------------------------------
Spell 1: Spring Mist "Engulfing Miasma"
13/15 (4/5 | 9/10)

This is smooth. There's something about those lanes from the top that makes them look and feel very pleasant to dodge.
The progression with the increasing sizes of red bullets is nice, too.

--------------------------------------------------
Spell 2: Toxic Flower "Daisy Chains for the Delirious"
11/15 (4/5 | 7/10)

The rotating chains get incredibly awkward, but it seems like it's always fair. 

--------------------------------------------------
Spell 3: Floral Magic Vine "Medicine for a Bleeding Heart"
12/15 (3.5/5 | 8.5/10)

The warning-line-based streaming makes for some very interesting gameplay. I like it.
The second half of the pattern feels disconnected from the first, though.

--------------------------------------------------
Spell 4: Life Sign "Migrating Butterflies"
12/15 (4/5 | 8/10)

Not much to say here. It all works very well.

--------------------------------------------------
Spell 5: Night Bloom "Beware the Forest's Thorns"
12/15 (4/5 | 8/10)

This is good too. The vertical streaming followed by rising vines makes for a very nice flow.

--------------------------------------------------
Spell 6: "A Curious Case of Spring Fever"
12/15 (4/5 | 8/10)

This is a nice way to conclude the fight. I have nothing to say against it.

Final score: 20.5/25

Closing notes
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-This is probably the entry where I have the fewest things to say. It's an incredibly clean script with very solid danmaku.
