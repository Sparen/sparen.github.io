Badz's BHA2 Judging: Mysterious Sunflare by JDude
The final score is out of 25, split as follows:

Gameplay: 15 points
How well the script plays. Each pattern is judged individually.
The individual scores are further split as 5/15 for concept and 10/15 for gameplay.

Creativity and theme: 5 points
How well the script uses the contest theme. Based on having a fitting pair of characters, and making good use of both of them.

Aesthetics and presentation: 5 points
How good the script looks and feels. Includes visuals, as well as other presentation aspects like sound effects and the system.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Creativity and theme: 3.5/5
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Those are some very unlikely allies indeed. How'd you come up with this one?
The patterns provide a few interesting interactions between the two, at least.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Aesthetics and presentation: 3.5/5
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The script looks fairly standard. The custom title screen is nice!

Gameplay: 9.3/15
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------
Nonspell 1
8.5/15 (3/5 | 5.5/10)

This seems like it's a streaming pattern, but the two characters' attacks being out of sync makes it incredibly hard to keep up with.

--------------------------------------------------
Spell 1: Star Slicer "Unidentified Mechanic"
10.5/15 (4/5 | 6.5/10)

I like the pattern itself, but it's all very slow and takes a long time to get going.
It could be more interesting if Nue started firing immediately or Sunny had an intro wave to get things going.

--------------------------------------------------
Nonspell 2
10.5/15 (4.5/5 | 6/10)

This is a very interesting combination of that one Nue nonspell and Sunny's usual style.
I can't keep up with the random bullets when Nue is firing, though.

--------------------------------------------------
Spell 2: Falling Light "Myouren's Unidentified Ring"
11.5/15 (4/5 | 7.5/10)

All the components here work nicely together.
It's weird to see Nue firing those aiming beams when Sunny is usually the one doing so in this script, though.

--------------------------------------------------
Nonspell 3
7.5/15 (2.5/5 | 5/10)

The curving on Nue's shots make them incredibly unpleasant to dodge when trying to stream the other bullets. The part where she cover the screen in darkness is nice, though.
Also, the two characters' patterns don't stay in sync, which doesn't seem intentional.

--------------------------------------------------
Spell 3: UFO Invasion "Seamless Refraction"
7/15 (3/5 | 4/10)

I like the idea, but this is one of those final spells that just combine a bunch of attacks without forming a coherent whole.
Also, Sunny seems to disappear without ending the fight once the last phase is reached? What's going on?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Final score: 16.3/25
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Closing notes
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-I was dying a lot while playing this, especially during the nonspells. I would recommend including some easier difficulty options in future entries.
-Overall, it's a script with interesting concepts, but the execution could use work in a few places.
