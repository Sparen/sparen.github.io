Badz's BHA2 Judging: Oops! All BoWaP by Bagoum
Played on Very Hard mode

The final score is out of 25, split as follows:

Gameplay: 15 points
How well the script plays. Each pattern is judged individually.
The individual scores are further split as 5/15 for concept and 10/15 for gameplay.

Creativity and theme: 5 points
How well the script uses the contest theme. Based on having a fitting pair of characters, and making good use of both of them.

Aesthetics and presentation: 5 points
How good the script looks and feels. Includes visuals, as well as other presentation aspects like sound effects and the system.

Creativity and theme: 3.5/5
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This certainly has a creative idea, but why Junko? Manipulating bullets really isn't her kind of thing.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Aesthetics and presentation: 3.5/5
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It's the standard Danmokou look. I don't have anything to comment on.

Gameplay: 9.6/15
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------
Pattern 1: "Border of Wave, Particle, Vector, and Curve"
7.5/15 (2/5 | 5.5/10)

Well... the bullets curve. Not particularly interesting.

--------------------------------------------------
Pattern 2: "Border of Wave, Particle, Plane, and Sphere"
10/15 (4/5 | 6/10)

The dodging is fine, but it starts feeling tedious by the time it ends.

--------------------------------------------------
Pattern 3: "Border of Wave, Particle, Offset, and Origin"
9.5/15 (3/5 | 6.5/10)

The repositioning looks neat, but in the end, it just creates a second BoWaP on top of the first one. The bullets coming back from behind are a point of interest, at least.

--------------------------------------------------
Pattern 4: "Border of Wave, Particle, Line, and Shape"
12/15 (4/5 | 8/10)

I like this a lot. The curving lasers look great, and the dodging required to handle the crows is pretty fun.

--------------------------------------------------
Pattern 5: "Border of Wave, Particle, Area, and Perimeter"
8/15 (2.5/5 | 5.5/10)

BoWaP with some random bullets thrown in... not particularly interesting.

--------------------------------------------------
Pattern 6: "Border of Wave, Particle, View, and Reflection"
9/15 (3/5 | 6/10)

I'm not sure what's going on here. What's making those lasers spawn?
The omnidirectional dodging with them is acceptable, at least.

--------------------------------------------------
Pattern 7: "Border of Wave, Particle, Continuity, and Gap"
7.5/15 (2/5 | 5.5/10)

BoWaP with a few lasers mixed in. Not particularly interesting either.

--------------------------------------------------
Pattern 8: "Border of Wave, Particle, Circle, and Lily"
11/15 (3.5/5 | 7.5/10)

The shifting flower-like circles look nice and are pretty fun to dodge.

--------------------------------------------------
Pattern 9: "Border of Wave, Particle, Touhou, and CAVE"
12/15 (4/5 | 8/10)

The concept is neat, and the curving BoWaP combined with the fire works fairly well.

Final score: 16.6/25

Closing notes
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-I like this script's premise, but a lot of the resulting patterns are just uninteresting. I can't help but notice my favorites ended up being the least BoWaP-like ones.
