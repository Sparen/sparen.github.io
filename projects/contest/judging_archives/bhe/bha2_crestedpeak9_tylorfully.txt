Judging notes from Crested
"TimeAndRhyme Duo" by yeet1234567890
==========================================================
Judging criteria and point distribution are as follows:
Playability - Gameplay (max 15 points)
Creativity - Contest Theme (max 5 points)
Aesthetics - Appearance (max 5 points)
Max score per judge is 25.
==========================================================
Gameplay - For gameplay, I will score each pattern individually and average the scores to get the final gameplay score.
 
Non 1 - Well, it's very standard, but it works. 11/15
Spell 1 - Danmakufu's default straight laser functions has a big problem with the delay lasers being very difficult to see at angles. This is no exception, and it ruins the spell. They also take too long to disappear, which makes the pattern look significantly more threatening than it should be... 6/15
Non 2 - Aimed lasers with random knives is a very simple pattern, but it works. 12/15
Spell 2 - This pattern becomes 100% trivial just by moving downwards. 6/15
Non 3 - Legitimately a decent pattern with how the knife crosses force a lot of macro movement between the lanes of rainbow walls. 13/15
Spell 3 - Eh, it's fine I guess. 12/15
Non 4 - It's a little boring since it's just lanes... 10/15
Spell 4 - This doesn't seem fair in the slightest. 5/15
Non 5 - Wavy walls works but it's still quite boring... 11/15
Spell 5 -I'm not sure what this was trying to do, honestly. It doesn't quite work as Kaguya doesn't take any damage though. 11/15

Penalty - This script has two fatal flaws that I must dock points from gameplay from. Despite being a duo boss fight, only damage taken by Sakuya will be reflected in the health; Kaguya has a shot hitbox but never decreases the spell HP, which is a very bad thing in a duo boss fight. Additionally, you didn't provide a shottype to play the script with, which forces up to use the default ExRumia player for fairness...which means I have to dock the final gameplay score by 2.
Overall Gameplay - 7.7/15 (with the penalty)
It's playable, but could be much better.
==========================================================
Creativity (Contest Theme) - 2/5
Neither Sakuya nor Kaguya's theming was really invoked. Time manipulation seemed to be the pairing theme you presented, but they didn't use them very well.
==========================================================
Aesthetics - 2/5
The music doesn't loop, for one, but additionally the graphics on the spell UI is very very broken. Finally, many patterns suffer from (0,0) spawning... 
==========================================================
Total Score - 11.7/25
I realize that you're a new scripter, but there are some glaring flaws in the script that simply can't be looked past. For a start, try to fix some of the basic issues here and think of patterns that might take better advantage of Sakuya's timestop or Kaguya's treasures/eternity manipulation,.
