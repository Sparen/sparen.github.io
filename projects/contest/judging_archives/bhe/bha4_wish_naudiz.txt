Wish's BHA4 Judging - Unworldly Manifestations
-=Naudiz's Entry=-
 
Rubric:
-20 points per pattern - 10 points to creativity and pattern aesthetics, 10 points to fun factor and pattern design.
-30 points towards general aesthetics, sound, and polish.  (For the record, *average* aesthetics is essentially the defaults per engine, and is at around a 6/10 per category)
-(Usual contest-specific bonuses will be omitted due to contest theme being OCs lol)
At the end, the total points will be divided by the total possible points, and then multiplied by <contest average> to get your final score.
 
Nonspell 1: 13.5/20
Shapes.  Many of them.
Pretty basic to dodge, actually, but it looks quite nice.
7.5/10 - Creativity/Aesthetics, 6/10 - Fun/Design

<Nameless Asterism>: 17/20
Looks cool as hell, great idea, somehow has variety (I didn't expect that), keeps me on my toes.  Wow.
9/10 - Creativity/Aesthetics, 8/10 - Fun/Design

Nonspell 2: 15.5/20
Looks better than the previous non and dodges are more fun too, nice.
8.5/10 - Creativity/Aesthetics, 7/10 - Fun/Design

<Triangular Ouroboros>: 18/20
Very unique visual identity, looks insane, gets crazy towards the end to dodge... honestly I wasn't expecting to like this as much as I did.
9/10 - Creativity/Aesthetics, 9/10 - Fun/Design

Nonspell 3: 18/20
This non is pretty crazy and has multiple different layers to it, woah...
It's awesome, more nons should be this interesting.  Looks pretty cool too.
9/10 - Creativity/Aesthetics, 9/10 - Fun/Design

<The Most Marvelous Spiral>: 15/20
Wow, what a meme.
I honestly have no damn clue how to dodge this properly but it's pretty fun to try and follow.  Looks nice.
8/10 - Creativity/Aesthetics, 7/10 - Fun/Design

Nonspell 4: 14.5/20
Where's Keiki and Junko when you need them.
I like how each shape turns into the opposite, it's an effect I certainly didn't expect!
Neat, looks cool, decent to dodge.
7.5/10 - Creativity/Aesthetics, 7/10 - Fun/Design

<Cycle of Emptiness and Form>: 14/20
So tell me, how much of this was rejected patterns from your other BHA award-winning script lmao
Takes the previous nonspell gimmick up to 11.
Honestly, this is *insanely* hard to read.  I don't fathom how you dodge this properly.  Too many directions for shit to come from.
But it's very well executed, so I don't know how to score it...
8/10 - Creativity/Aesthetics, 6/10 - Fun/Design
 
AESTHETIC: 26/30
Looks: I'm very personally not a big fan of this very Geometry Wars visual style, but it's hard to deny how much went into it, and it's impressive.  Bomb cancels also feel sooo good due to the effect. 10/10
Sound: Fairly...standard?  I don't feel very strongly about the music and attacks could maybe use more sound design work. 6/10
Polish: If this is only a trial of TNA, I am *extremely curious* about what your plans are for the full version.  Polish is EVERYWHERE with this system, it feels like your baby haha. 10/10
 
SUM OF PATTERNS: 125.5/160
AESTHETIC: 26/30
TOTAL: 152.5/190 * 25 = 20.06/25

Wowza.  I'm extremely impressed by this.  Seriously consistently good quality and polished to a shine.
It's a divisive visual style for me, but overall the script is so fun I don't really care.  Frankly, stuff feels a bit unclear to read and I feel like I'm getting away with way too much with a tiny hitbox lmao
Best of luck on TNA getting a full release (???)
