Wish's BHA4 Judging - Unworldly Manifestations
-=DJ Medoroa's Entry=-
 
Rubric:
-20 points per pattern - 10 points to creativity and pattern aesthetics, 10 points to fun factor and pattern design.
-30 points towards general aesthetics, sound, and polish.  (For the record, *average* aesthetics is essentially the defaults per engine, and is at around a 6/10 per category)
-(Usual contest-specific bonuses will be omitted due to contest theme being OCs lol)
At the end, the total points will be divided by the total possible points, and then multiplied by <contest average> to get your final score.

AESTHETIC: 23/30
Looks: This is really high quality for a GameMaker engine, really solid.  You can totally improve it too 9/10
Sound: Sound is average 6/10
Polish: Honestly what continues to astound me is the quality of this engine, but there are a few quirks.  Overall though there's extra dialogue and other little touches 8/10
 
SUM OF PATTERNS: 171.5/300
AESTHETIC: 23/30
TOTAL: 217.5/330 * 25 = 16.47/25

To be 100% transparent with you, this was one of the last scripts I judged and I *massively* ran out of steam as a result.  Sorry, there's a lot of patterns and my critiques ended up being *far* less detailed.
Overall the script is pretty solid throughout with its own highs and lows, though I think there's massive room for improvement.
I'm still incredibly fascinated by your engine and want to see it improve too!
