Bullet Hell Artistry #2: Unlikely Allies
Judging notes from Crested
"Subconsciously Lunatic Eye" by Zino
==========================================================
Judging criteria and point distribution are as follows:
Playability - Gameplay (max 15 points)
Creativity - Contest Theme (max 5 points)
Aesthetics - Appearance (max 5 points)
Max score per judge is 25.
==========================================================
Gameplay - For gameplay, I will score each pattern individually and average the scores to get the final gameplay score.
 
Non 1 - Quite an easy non. Well, it's thematic I guess. 12/15
Spell 1 - The lines being used to spawn rose waves is an effective deterrent, while the rose waves themselves are still very doable. Good spell. 13.5/15
Non 2 - Another really easy non. It looks pretty more than anything else, but I don't think it really uses the characters' theming well. 12/15
Spell 2 - The giant spark forces movement, but it's not particularly challenging since there's more than plenty of time to go to the other side. 13/15
Non 3 - It's a bit simple, but it's decent. 12.5/15
Spell 3 - I like the wavy movement of the bullets, but the roses don't pose a threat when they shrink at the height you want to dodge them... 13/15
Spell 4 - Those roses are huge. It's a good survival, but I wish the final wave lasted for a little longer to force a dodge through those dense rings. 14/15
Spell 5 - Reisen's pattern is really neat, but Koishi just spamming roses is a little disappointing. 14/15

Overall Gameplay - 13/15
For Extra difficulty these patterns are a little too easy, but they're still good patterns.
==========================================================
Creativity (Contest Theme) - 3.5/5 (Okay)
I'm not really clear what the theming was between these two, but they both used their patterns alright. I'd have hoped for more from Koishi, since it feels like a lot of her pattern is relegated to spamming rose bullets...
==========================================================
Aesthetics - 4/5 (Functional)
It works just fine and doesn't interfere with the dodging.
==========================================================
Total Score - 20.5/25
Apart from the engine choice, it's a pretty standard script. Not the best use of duo boss, but not bad either.
