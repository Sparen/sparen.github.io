The final score is out of 25, split as follows:

The individual scores are further split as 5/15 for concept and 10/15 for gameplay.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Creativity and theme: 4.5/5
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A fitting choice, with some uncommon characters. The Perfect Possession fight is a nice twist.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Aesthetics and presentation: 3/5
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Everything looks fine, but there are no big stand-out features either.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gameplay: 10.9/15
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------
Nonspell 1
10.5/15 (3.5/5 | 7/10)

It's a fitting way to start the fight. I can't really find anything to comment on.

--------------------------------------------------
Spell 1: Malice "Sudden Horde of Will-O'-The-Wisps"
11.5/15 (4/5 | 7.5/10)

It takes some figuring out, but it plays well enough once you know how to handle it.

--------------------------------------------------
Nonspell 2
12/15 (4.5/5 | 7.5/10)

This is a really interesting spin on Kisume's abilities. I like it!
The randomness on the falling bullets is annoying sometimes, but it's still a good pattern.

--------------------------------------------------
Spell 2: Haunted Bridge "A Path Cursed by Hashihime"
12/15 (4/5 | 8/10) 

It looks nice, and the streaming is interesting to pull off.

--------------------------------------------------
Nonspell 3
8/15 (3/5 | 5/10)

Streaming lasers through Parsee's walls is a real pain, and it's hard to get some worthwhile damage on the boss without taking serious risks with Kisume's opening attack.

--------------------------------------------------
Spell 3: Horror Sign "The Stalker Right Behind You"
11.5/15 (4.5/5 | 7/10)

A new take on one of Parsee's spells, and with a good flow to it too.
My only issue with it is that the chase sequence with Kisume lasts longer than it needs to.

Final score: 18.4/25

Closing notes
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-This is one of those scripts that's hard to comment on. It could use extra visual flair, but everything else is very solid.
