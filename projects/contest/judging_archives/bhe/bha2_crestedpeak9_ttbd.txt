Bullet Hell Artistry #2: Unlikely Allies
Judging notes from Crested
"Shipwreck Showdown" by TTBD
==========================================================
Judging criteria and point distribution are as follows:
Playability - Gameplay (max 15 points)
Creativity - Contest Theme (max 5 points)
Aesthetics - Appearance (max 5 points)
Max score per judge is 25.
==========================================================
Gameplay - For gameplay, I will score each pattern individually and average the scores to get the final gameplay score.
 
Non 1 - Lanes + aimed with some random elements. It works well. 13.5/15
Spell 1 - Anchor spam was used to force movement effectively, while the spirals of droplets provided a constant difficulty with the random fireballs making for extra variation. Very good pattern. 14.5/15
Non 2 - Uh... isn't this mostly just streaming? The spirits need to be killed or it's way too hard, but the pattern seems a bit too simple. The scythe is cool though. 11/15
Spell 2 - This spell varying based on the character is a cool concept, but unfortunately not very balanced (Futo's random icicles are really fast). The gimmick also boils down to just stopping fire occasionally, so it's not really that interesting... 12/15
Non 3 - It's a good nonspell. Not much else to say. 13.5/15
Spell 3 - Cool survival, though it seems a bit on the easy side? 14.5/15
Spell 4 - A spell that requires good positioning. The element of aimed bullets coming from the obscured "spirit" bullets is a nice touch. 14.5/15

Overall Gameplay - 13.4/15
Quite fast-paced patterns that test dodging in a variety of directions, but there are some patterns that I feel could have been improved to bring up the average even more.
==========================================================
Creativity (Contest Theme) - 4.5/5 (Superb)
It's a good pairing whose patterns were executed very well, making full advantage of their duo boss nature.
==========================================================
Aesthetics - 4.5/5 (Superb)
I really like the boss position indicators, and that intro animation is... something. The UI is quite impressive.
==========================================================
Total Score - 22.4/25
Fairly fast-paced arcade-style script that works very well.
