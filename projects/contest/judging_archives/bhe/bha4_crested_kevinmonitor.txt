Bullet Hell Artistry #4: Unworldly Manifestations
Judging notes from Crested
"Enigma of the Storm" by Kevinmonitor
=====================================================================================================================================
My judging criteria is entirely based on pattern design with bonuses or penalties for other factors such as gameplay systems, presentation and creativity.
Each boss pattern will be rated up to 10 points and the overall score will be the average of all patterns.
=====================================================================================================================================
No difficulty options given. 
Pls give dialogue skip next time

Non 1 - The completely aimed nature of the non makes the flashiness a bit pointless, but it works. 7/10
Spell 1 - Very good pattern that forces misdirecting in a not really conventional way. 9/10
Non 2 - Another very well made pattern. 9/10
Spell 2 - I'm afraid I'm really not a fan of this pattern, especially with how huge the arrow bullets are. 6/10
Non 3 - Decent non that forces specific movement. 8/10
Spell 3 - With visual obstruction patterns it needs to be fairly simple and I do think this works well. It just doesn't look... very good. 8/10
Spell 4 - (RSS Extra did it better) Why did this need visual obstruction gimmick 7/10
Spell 5 - It can get a bit... messy RNG on the final phase. Actually might happen on the previous phases as well. 7/10

Bonus/Penalty - The enlarged bullets do work well but I just can't deal with the arrows... Other than that it's a fairly standard script with a unique art style.

Overall Score - 7.6/10
A decent script with clearly thought put into the pattern design, though some spells could have done with a little more variation and overall more polishing.
