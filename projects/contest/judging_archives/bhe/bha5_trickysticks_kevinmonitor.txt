Bullet Hell Artistry #5 - Kevinmonitor
For this contest I'm using a 25 point rating scale because I feel like it.
 
Danmaku Quality: 15/25
 
Danmaku Quality encompasses the quality of the danmaku in your script. "Good" patterns will equal a "good" score in this category. What makes a pattern good is subjective, but the #1 factor is fun. A flashy, gorgeous pattern that isn't fun won't fare well here. Note that aesthetic factors can still factor into this - proper usage of sound effects and graphics can make an unfair pattern fair, and improper usage of those can make an otherwise-fair pattern unfair.

To be more clear, an "average" pattern is a 5. You can gain or lose points and I'll probably tell you why.
 
Individual patterns will be rated out of 10. The average of that will be taken and scaled to calculate the Danmaku Quality score.
 
Aesthetics: 5/25
 
This category encompasses how your entry looks (and sounds). While danmaku should absolutely come first, visual and audio elements are also a part of the gameplay experience. A high score in this category comes from your script being aesthetically appealing without being distracting.
 
Adherence to Contest Theme: 5/25
 
5 points will be dedicated to judging your choice of character and their danmaku. A high score in this category means you did a good job of integrating a character from another franchise into Touhou, and it means that both of your characters' danmaku works well together.

Played with the first player team on Original difficulty.

Nonspell 1: Pretty good pattern to start. Not much to say here, good work. 8/10.

Spell 1: I think the telegraph isn't super helpful in knowing that you need to go to the top of the screen, but other than that I like this pattern. Keeping the haniwa's bouncing in mind is kind of tough, but this is still good. 7.5/10.

Nonspell 2: Another good nonspell where both contribute. I think this is a bit better than the previous non, so it gets a bit higher score. 8.25/10.

Spell 2: So a spell where you ignore the rain and focus on the other bullets, which actually aren't too difficult to dodge if you can avoid going cross-eyed from the rainy visual clutter. I think the rainbow bullets have some amount of randomness that can cause nastier waves than necessary, but I can still do it consistently. 7/10.

Spell 3: Fairly easy pattern (and relatively slow compared to the last four). Having to circle Sukune seems quite abrupt, but besides that I appreciate the break. 7.5/10.

Spell 4: I honestly think that the last two phases are quite a bit easier than the first two. Dodging in such a confined space is more of a pain than fast-paced streaming to me. Otherwise this is also pretty fine. 7.5/10.

Danmaku Score: 7.625/10 (scaled to 11.4375/15)
======================================================================================================================
 
Aesthetically it's good - work was evidently put into all of the graphics, and overall the script seems to have a lighthearted feel. Getting any kind of feel from a script is always a plus, so I applaud that. 3.75/5.
======================================================================================================================
 
I think the characters cooperate very well, with very little overshadowing of each other. Good! 4.5/5.
 
OVERALL SCORE 11.4375 + 3.75 + 4.5 = 19.6875/25
