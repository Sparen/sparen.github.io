Bullet Hell Artistry #5 - Pickled Cow
For this contest I'm using a 25 point rating scale because I feel like it.
 
Danmaku Quality: 15/25
 
Danmaku Quality encompasses the quality of the danmaku in your script. "Good" patterns will equal a "good" score in this category. What makes a pattern good is subjective, but the #1 factor is fun. A flashy, gorgeous pattern that isn't fun won't fare well here. Note that aesthetic factors can still factor into this - proper usage of sound effects and graphics can make an unfair pattern fair, and improper usage of those can make an otherwise-fair pattern unfair.

To be more clear, an "average" pattern is a 5. You can gain or lose points and I'll probably tell you why.
 
Individual patterns will be rated out of 10. The average of that will be taken and scaled to calculate the Danmaku Quality score.
 
Aesthetics: 5/25
 
This category encompasses how your entry looks (and sounds). While danmaku should absolutely come first, visual and audio elements are also a part of the gameplay experience. A high score in this category comes from your script being aesthetically appealing without being distracting.
 
Adherence to Contest Theme: 5/25
 
5 points will be dedicated to judging your choice of character and their danmaku. A high score in this category means you did a good job of integrating a character from another franchise into Touhou, and it means that both of your characters' danmaku works well together.

Nonspell 1: The laser stuff doesn't interest me very much, but the stuff afterwards is good! 7.5/10.

Spell 1: While the big laser is visually impressive, the pattern comes down to dodging Scarlet Gensokyo 0.5 in the corner while hoping you don't die to bubbles that are obscured by a giant laser. I don't like it much. 3/10.

Nonspell 2: Remilia's opener section is boring, but the pattern after is good. Will this be a nonspell theme? 7.25/10.

Spell 2: Much better than the last spell. Doesn't really stand out to me a ton, but it's better than average. I like micrododgy streaming. 6.5/10.

Nonspell 3: The bouncy knives are spoooky in the hard way but at least you don't have to dodge the Scarlet Meistern't bullets. About on par with the second non. 7.25/10.

Spell 3: The tornado looks neat! The pattern is...not all that interesting in concept, since it's Dodge the Rain, but it's fun enough to get across while dodging the Rain as it ramps up. 7/10. 

Danmaku Score: 6.41666666666666666667/10 (scaled to 9.625/15)
======================================================================================================================
 
Aesthetically this script is...inconsistent. Most of the visuals are impressive, but then the title screen is Lol and we have sliding Remilia. The good outweighs the bad, so I'll say it's 3.5/5.
======================================================================================================================
 
I think the characters work together pretty well to make combined patterns that utilize both of their gimmicks. Or, in plain English, it gud. 3.75/5.
 
OVERALL SCORE 9.625 + 3.5 + 3.75 = 16.875/25
