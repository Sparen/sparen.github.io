Wish's BHA4 Judging - Unworldly Manifestations
-=Marchosiasnull's Entry=-
 
Rubric:
-20 points per pattern - 10 points to creativity and pattern aesthetics, 10 points to fun factor and pattern design.
-30 points towards general aesthetics, sound, and polish.  (For the record, *average* aesthetics is essentially the defaults per engine, and is at around a 6/10 per category)
-(Usual contest-specific bonuses will be omitted due to contest theme being OCs lol)
At the end, the total points will be divided by the total possible points, and then multiplied by <contest average> to get your final score.

Nonspell 1: 15.5/20
Pretty neat pattern!  Introduces the theming of her nons quite well.  Minor potential z-sorting issues?  But the bubbles being invisible in the middle makes it easier.
It's a bit tough to read, but fun!  She can also go a bit low on the screen, but I'm nitpicking lol
8/10 - Creativity/Aesthetics, 7.5/10 - Fun/Design

Cursed Literature "Tomino's Hell": 14/20
In practice, just a fancy streaming spell.  But I do like the flavor quite a bit!
8/10 - Creativity/Aesthetics, 6/10 - Fun/Design

Nonspell 2: 12/20
Subtly different from nonspell 1...but loses points for being functionally not different at all.
6/10 - Creativity/Aesthetics, 6/10 - Fun/Design

Rope Shrine Maiden "Five Gates": 13.5/20
Spleen Eater with additional Fatal Frame reference, I do like how the knives work and they are pretty threatening
6.5/10 - Creativity/Aesthetics, 7/10 - Fun/Design

Nonspell 3: 12.5/20
The nons are starting to blend together now...I like the style and this one is different than the first two but it's slower and a bit more boring, I feel.
Maybe my tastes are just towards faster pace, though
6.5/10 - Creativity/Aesthetics, 6/10 - Fun/Design

Book Curse "Anathema from Theiving[sic]": 15/20
I like the double-ended streaming that you're working with here, it's pretty neat!
Minor point of criticism regarding the amulets fired to the sides - I like how they don't have hitboxes, but I think it's unusual that they sync with my y position.
7.5/10 - Creativity/Aesthetics, 7.5/10 - Fun/Design

Nonspell 4: 15.5/20
Now THIS is what I'm talking about, much more fun to dodge and keeps her theme intact
7/10 - Creativity/Aesthetics, 8.5/10 - Fun/Design

Kurosaki Sign "Remains of a Burning Castle": 13/20
This...feels like it was directly ripped from Padma?  I don't know if it was.  It's ok, I don't feel very much about it lol
6.5/10 - Creativity/Aesthetics, 6.5/10 - Fun/Design

Nonspell 5: 16/20
The best non of the bunch and a direct improvement over non 4.  A subtle difference that matters a LOT
8/10 - Creativity/Aesthetics, 8/10 - Fun/Design

Okiku "Hide and Seek": 10.5/20
The Len'en survival.
It's a bit drawn out for being one main attack and turning the amulets into knives feels like it's...not very impactful?
It's a bit of neat flavor but it's...at best ok.
5.5/10 - Creativity/Aesthetics, 5/10 - Fun/Design

Seimei "Longevity of A Blossoming Life": 13/20
I like the pentagram theming surrounding it, and no phase feels like it overstays its welcome, which is solid!
The last phase feels like a bit of a directly lifted non 5, but it's just as good as it was there as a single part of a larger spell.
Overall. decent final spell.
6.5/10 - Creativity/Aestheics, 6.5/10 - Fun/Design

AESTHETIC: 20.5/30
Looks: They're passable.  I did notice a few lifted effects (which is fine, we all do it from time to time) but with SP and (...fairies of sorcery? for the pause menu).  Not taking points off, but noting to just be wary if you do this 6.5/10
Sound: Good music choices and the usual average sfx.  The volume balance is very unusual, the sfx are VERY quiet, so a slight dock. 5.5/10
Polish: Kudos for even having a full on package and stage!  It's not the best one I've ever seen, but I really appreciate the effort put into it. 8.5/10

SUM OF PATTERNS: 150.5/220
AESTHETIC: 20.5/30
TOTAL: 171/250 * 25 = 17.1/25

Pretty good script!  I think this is the first I've seen from you, which would make sense.  It's got some "new scripter" qualities, but there's definitely a glimmer of potential here.
Keep working at it and I bet you'll be one of the next superstars :eyes:
