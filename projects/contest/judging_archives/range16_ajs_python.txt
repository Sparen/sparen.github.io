Little Mermaid - by Python

AJS's Supercool Judging System!

* My focus is on fun factor, fairness, and challenge of the danmaku.  Aesthetics will be a MINOR component to reward going the extra mile or punish bad design choices.
* I will score your entry based on the difficulty that is most "playable" for me (typically somewhere around Normal/Hard) while still being fun and fair
	** I will not factor in how well your difficulty settings are balanced, however.  That'd just kinda complicate things.
	** It would still be to your benefit to make balanced difficulties though--or at least more than one--so I can find a difficulty most suited to me for scoring

My scoring system will be as such:
	>0 -- Unplayable (i.e. broken, extremely buggy, etc.)
	>1 -- Terrible/No effort
	>2 -- Bad
	>3 -- Needs work
	>4 -- Has potential
	>5 -- Average
	>6 -- Okay
	>7 -- Decent
	>8 -- Good
	>9 -- VERY good
	>10 -- One of the best things I've seen

		-Stage portion (if you have one): X/10
		-Each nonspell (midboss included): X/10
		-Each spell card (midboss included): X/10
	*All scores will then be averaged, then multiplied by 2 to give a final score of XX.XX/20.00
	*Aesthetic bonus 
	(May be applied to individual pattern scores for making especially pretty/eye-sore attacks, or to overall score for general script aesthetics):
		*You will receive neither a penalty nor bonus for making a decent to look at script that doesn't stand out.  I don't want to tip things in the favor of advanced scripters too much.
		-Score bonus for going above and beyond to make something beautiful: +4% if applied to individual attack score; +2% if applied to overall script score
		-Score penalty for making poor aesthetic choices that make certain things hard to see or look at: -4% if applied to individual attack score; -2% if applied to overall script score
	
I will also do my best to provide commentary on every aspect of your script throughout my judging, pointing out things you did right and things you could
improve on.  I wouldn't call myself an expert, but these comments will just be my honest opinions and advice on what you could do for future scripts, or if you
wanted to improve your contest entry script after the contest.

***DISCLAIMER: Please don't get hurt if I give your script bad/mediocre scores.  I try to be as strict and objective as possible when scoring, so even scripts that I personally liked or thought
were pretty decent may still get "meh" scores from me.  I try not to sugarcoat things in the hopes that you can improve, and so long as you're willing to listen to advice, I have nothing but
respect for you.  Also, I'm just really really picky...  So please bear with me ^^; **

Difficulty judged: -ORIGINAL-

Stage: 10/10
	*This stage was incredibly fun to play, and incredibly well-balanced in my opinion. It feels like something right out of an actual Touhou game

Seija Nonspell: 4/10
	*Sadly, in contrast to the stage, I felt this nonspell was very underwhelming.
	*There's hardly any challenge other than "Follow the path the bullets make." It doesn't help that the path is the same every time since there's no variety
	in the pattern between waves

Seija Spell ("Gait of a Drunken Sailor"): 2/10
	*I'm not at all a fan of how the bullets suddenly reverse direction when they turn dark.  Especially since the screen-swinging gimmick already makes this spell
	hard to begin with.  I got cheapshotted tons of times and just had to resort to bombing to get through

Wakasagihime Nonspell 1: 6/10
	*Standard not-too-hard/not-too-easy opener, not much to say here

Wakasagihime Spell 1 (Water Sign "Water Fountain Palace"): 7/10
	*It's decently fun to dodge, but it feels really same-y wave after wave.  It would've been nice if you could've addded a bit more variety to how the lasers
	move each round

Wakasagihime Nonspell 2: 8/10
	*Simple yet fun to dodge nonspell.
	*But if it were me, I would've added more than just one ring of large round bullets :v

Wakasagihime Spell 2 (Bubble Sign "Underwater Prison"): 9/10
	*A "warm-up" wave may have been good here, but once you get the hang of the pattern it's REALLY fun to dodge!

Wakasagihime Nonspell 3: 8.32/10
	*Another simple but very fun nonspell to dodge, even despite the randomness inherent with Wakasagihime's "theme"
	*The way you had the bullet colors transition in her spiral was just really beautiful. (and mesmerizing @_@). [+4% AESTHETIC BONUS]

Wakasagihime Spell 3 (Fish Song "Siren's Silent Song"): 8/10
	*Fun and fair pattern, and an interesting gimmick that keeps the player on their toes
	*Though I might tone down the speed of the red music notes Waka herself shoots.  There's already a lot going on onscreen, and I've gotten hit quite a few
	times by the bullets because they caught me off-guard.  Other than that though, the pattern's very fun

Wakasagihime Nonspell 4: 9/10
	*A very interesting pattern with a lot of variety.  No two waves seem exactly alike, it seems

Wakasagihime Spell 4 (Mermaid "Suspicious Figure Lurking in the Dark"): 7/10
	*Waka's semi-random movements still kinda puzzle me...  and when I first saw this, I actually thought it was a survival
	*While it would've been nice to inject a little variety by having her come in from the right side, or changing up the different types of paths she can take,
	this was a decently fun spell to dodge

Wakasagihime Spell 5 (Scale Sign "Gleaming Giant Rainbow Scale"): 4/10
	*This spell could DEFINITELY benefit from a "demonstration wave", or at least a longer wait-time in between waves.  It feels like sensory overload when you've
	got all these heart bullets exploding while ANOTHER wave is already on its way

Wakasagihime Spell 6 ("Misty Ocean"): 8/10
	*While simple in execution, this spell is suitably challenging enough and helps keep tension as the waves build upon each other


Average Score: 90.32/130 = 69.48% + 2% AESTHETIC BONUS = 71.48%

FINAL SCORE: 14.30/20

Final Comments:
	-Very well done!  I'm impressed~
	-Aside from a few patterns that I didn't really like, this was overall a really fun and challenging script!
	-I'm still laughing at "Wakasagihime tries to make an intimidating face.  It's not very effective."
