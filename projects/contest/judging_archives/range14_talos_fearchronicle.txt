-Danmaku- (15 point)

Non-spell 1 :
This non-spell gave me "wow" reaction for the first time I played. It's completely original,fun,and fair. I absolutely have any complaints. It's very very good.
[15/15]

Traceback "World Line Leading to the End"
Although the "DNA" pattern look very nice, they're a bit too hard to dodge because of their speed.
Still a really good spell,though.
[18.5/20]

Non-spell 2 :
Red stars caught me off guard, the rest is good.
[13/15]

Fermion "Exciusive Existence"
A very neat concept spell card. Danmaku is very nice.
Bubbles sometimes seem to stick with the left/right of the screen. They aren't bounced as they should be, and constantly spamming purple amulets (I don't know this is intention or nor, but it's pretty weird). Anyway, they didn't affect the danmaku quality much.
[18/20]

Non-spell 3 :
A bit too easy compare to penultimate non-spell.
The lasers graphic are gorgeous,though.
[13.5/15]

Quantum "Silent Dilaton"
The oval bullets are quite intimidating, and they're pretty too fast,too.
Anyway, I kinda like this.
[17.5/20]

Gaze Upon The World End From Within This Omega Loop!
Holy shit the effects are amazing.
Holy shit Renko use Heroines' weapons, and all of them play very well.
Holy shit patterns are great
Holy shit this is awesome!
(One complaint though, I think you overdid with "guide lasers" on Sakuya knives, they're pretty distracting.)
[19/20]

Overall, for the main boss fight you get 13.74 points out of 15

-Visual & Effect- (3 point)
Everything you did with the visual are stunning. It's...simply magnificent.
The effects are gorgeous, as I mentioned before.
[2.75/3]

-Others (Difficulty,Aesthetics) - (2 point)
It has only one difficulty, but it pretty fair (for me).
Music play well and fit for the stage/boss fight.
[1.75/2]

Extra Credit (Stage,Midboss,Player,Gimmick,etc) (1 points)
Nice stage,nice player,nice dialogue,etc
[1/1]

P.S. : This script is too good that I felt it's too short. I really want to play more.x_x
