Umbra - Remilia

Stage - Why do the enemies not have a visible explosion when defeated?
MidNon 1 - I really like this pattern, actually more than the spell. It's a pretty unique and dynamic sakuya-esque pattern and is really fun to dodge.
Spell 2 - I really felt that the fireball walls were a bit too strict in where they forced you to be, but the pattern's pretty decent anyway.
Spell 4 - The final phas is pretty cool in that you had to dodge other bullets while moving through the phased out bullets. It's a better version of what ZUN did for Reisen's final spell (not the Last Spell) from IN.

General Notes - I was expecting a bit more creative uses of the Reisen gimmick than I got. The nonspells didn't innovate a whole lot either, outside of Sakuya's non. Though this didn't effect my score, I did really enjoy the dialogue and I really like the idea you went with for the sunglasses to substitute the Reisen eyes effect.
