Crested judging for Achy's Entry for the 20th RaNGE contest.
Script contains 4 nonspells and 4 spells.
No difficulty selection, and there was no player restriction.
It's important to confine player script selection or judges will tend to use default scripts like the default Rumia, which is less than ideal.
I judged with Ultima's DDC ReimuB.

I will be judging based on danmaku design, with a high focus on balance and creativity second.
Aesthetics are good and not distracting, so no penalty will be issued.

Nonspell 1: A good take on Sekibanki's bullet trains. It dies kind of fast, though.
15/20

Body Horror "Jinmenju Harvest": The pattern gets harder over time, which actually causes issues since the heads take so long to fly down after the warning lasers show up.
A simple fix would be to extend the lifetime of the warning lasers and move them along with the heads.
18/20

Nonspell 2: Isn't very different from a standard Sekibanki non and largely comes down to streaming.
14/20

Frostbite "Spine-Chilling Stare": The reflection of the cyan lasers provides an interesting style of area denial.
17/20

Nonspell 3: Cutting through the bullet snakes is an interesting challenge but there doesn't seem to be enough health for that to happen much.
16/20

Disorientation "Exploding Head Festival": This is a fantastic usage of blinding as the only important aspect to note during the short non-blind periods is the angle of the flower explosion.
19/20

Nonspell 4: Aside from Sekibanki's movement it's almost a normal Sekibanki nonspell.
15/20

Body Horror "Freakshow Theme Park": Now that is creative and the best spell in the entire contest.
20/20

Overall: 16.8/20
A good script overall with an amazing final spell. If some of the nons were changed this will be a fantastic script overall.
