		<p>As a Skype group (though it became a Discord group after Feb 10, 2016), the Land of Codes and Apertures never really had a place to store things, and when the Danmakufu Wiki admins decided to shut down the LOCAA pages, the backup logs for the first three contests were quickly retrieved and hosted on the Moriya Shrine -Extend- Forums. The forums were used to store the CURSE01 contest as well, and the information posts for the next two scripts were officially hosted there. However, on March 27, 2016, the owner of the forums and the staff came to a decision to close down the forums, and as a result, I will be posting all of the details here.</p>

<br>
The objective was to create a ZUN style boss fight using any Touhou character. Only resources from Touhou were to be used. As well, the spellcards were to be modified from the chosen character's existing spell cards.<br>
<br>
Ranking (from last to first):<br>

		<p style="font-family:monospace">Contest 3<br>
<br>
The observed gimmick has been "create a boss fight for yourself as any Pokémon of your choice, with the exception of legendary Pokémon". <br>
There used to be a restriction of resources imposed as Miplouf had made a full set of graphics for the contest, but it is no longer required. <br>
The Legendary Pokémon rule is debatable as Sparen is a Suicune for the contest. <br>
Contest due date is June 12, 2013.<br>
<br>
Ranking (from last to first):<br>
-Fonduemaster<br>
A Swampert boss fight. 4 nonspells and 6 spell cards.<br>
Danmakufu ph3 .0 pre11 is packaged with this script as it uses its own system script. (Fonduemaster did not want people potentially not being able to figure out where to put what portion of the script.)<br>
-Sparen (Sparen)<br>
A Suicune boss fight. 5 nonspells and 7 spell cards.<br>
Full of polar equations and curvy lasers<br>
Comes with a nonspell rush<br>
-banette (Miransu Uwabami)<br>
A Banette boss fight. 5 nonspells and 6 spell cards.<br>

		<p style="font-family:monospace">A Battle of Touhou's Iconic Figures!<br>
Contest Name: Overused All-Stars<br>
<br>
Rules<br>
<br>
You MAY choose whichever version of Danmakufu to code in.<br>
Please package your chosen version of Danmakufu when submitting your script, to prevent problems of confusion and errors (ph3 only).<br>
You MAY NOT use gimmicks uncharacteristic of your chosen character. EX: Suika w/ Timestop.<br>
You MAY use patterns that are really beautiful and original. If your patterns satisfy both criteria, you're good to go. A bunch of shiny crap everywhere is -not- beautiful.<br>
You MAY make your script however long you want, but it must have a boss script at least 3 nonspells and 4 spells long. And you need to have a custom player, idc how simple. MADE BY YOU.<br>
You MAY NOT use a character that is not overrated. Seriously if you're gonna make a Wriggle boss fight, save it for a standalone project.<br>
You MAY discuss code with each other, but don't make it a team project. Otherwise, elimination.<br>
<br>
Rules of Integers~: <br>
- Deadline is now October 25th.<br>
- You now need 4 spells and nonspells<br>
- Last Spells count as 1 spell and nonspell<br>
- Last Words only count as half a spell<br>
- Survivals count the same.<br>
- Those who've changed your characters need to have a Last Word.<br>

		<p style="font-family:monospace">Contest 4<br>
<br>
Unlikely Pairs<br>
<br>
Rules<br>
-You must have a custom player character that is an unlikely pair. You may make multiple shot types, but the two characters you use must be the same.<br>
-Your bosses must also be an unlikely pair.<br>
-You may use either 0.12m or ph3. If you use ph3, you must state which version it is optimized for on Bulletforge.<br>
-This is not a team project. Each person must submit his or her own work, but code help is encouraged. Please cite code.<br>
-Since the feature of this contest is how the player character interacts with the bosses, you are required to balance your bosses to fit the specific character set(s) you have made.<br>
-You must have at least two difficulties, preferably one normal difficulty and one harder.<br>
-Neither the player characters nor the bosses may be original characters. They must be characters from the Touhou Project and must be on the list provided in the Excel Spreadsheet.<br>
-All danmaku and shot types must be serious and accurate of the player. You may not have whipped cream danmaku or anything of the sort (unless there's an existing Touhou Character that it fits?)<br>
-YOU MAY NOT USE MIMA. You may now use PC-98 characters, but they cannot be paired with another character that appears in the same game. Sakuya/Yumeko is banned.<br>
-Minimum 5 attacks total (average Stage 2 boss), maximum 15 attacks total (between the 10 of a Stage 6 and the 18 of an Extra). Stages not included, but mid bosses count towards this amount<br>
<br>
Effects, execution, etc. and how the contest will be graded are all up to the judges. Remember that quality > quantity.<br>

<br>
Fury of the Rivals<br>
<br>
Rules<br>
-You must have two bosses who are rivals in some shape or form. If you want to have more than two at any point, the logistical problems are for you to solve.<br>
-You may use either 0.12m or ph3. If you use ph3, you must state which version it is optimized for on Bulletforge.<br>
-This is not a team project. Each person must submit his or her own work, but code help is encouraged. Please cite code.<br>
-GetAngleToPlayer or any arctan used to calculate the angle to the player are Banned, with the exception of optional stage portions, effects, and the final spell card.<br>
-Player must be solo. The player should not be a team. You may have different shot types and the like, but do not have a two vs. two.<br>
<br>
Suggestions<br>
-You should have at least two difficulties, preferably one normal difficulty and one harder.<br>
-Follow the spirit of Mystical Chain. The two enemies are fighting against each other in-game, but the player is what matters. Make patterns that work well in both hitting the other enemy and hitting the player. Note that doing this is MUCH MUCH HARDER than you would think. <br>
-Remember: The player is being caught in the crossfire. Feel free to move the enemies around the screen or use Fullscreen.<br>
-Regarding ZUN/CtC sprites looking drunk since they look straight at the playerish: It's up to you how you want to deal with this.<br>
<br>
Notes<br>
-There are no length requirements. However, please don't do only one attack because that sort of defeats the point.<br>
-Effects, execution, etc. and how the contest will be graded are all up to the judges. Remember that quality > quantity.<br>
-You are not required to use Touhou Characters. You may use Original Characters or PC-98 characters if you wish.<br>

<br>
Mini-Hakkero Contest: Backstory and Guidelines<br>
<br>
We all know that Marisa is a thief. She's compulsive, focuses on power, and is most importantly, careless*.<br>
<br>
This carelessness is what will come back to haunt her.<br>
<br>
During one of her visits to the Scarlet Devil Mansion, she "borrowed" some books as usual, and left using the same method that she came with. By flying through the window, and while dodging danmaku. Patchouli sighed and went back to attempting to organize books left on the floor. From the corner of her eye, a glint caught her attention. "Hmm..."<br>
<br>
Marisa, relaxing after her heist, tried to feel for the mini-Hakkero in her pockets. It wasn't in her left, nor in her right, and after using some basic tracking magic, wasn't in her house at all. In fact, it seemed to be quite a distance away. Marisa wondered where she could have left it. The last time she had a use for it was when she...<br>
<br>
"Oh crap."<br>
<br>
Patchouli was instructing some fairies in the use of new artifacts. "So, you just use these as catalysts for what power you may have. I know I cloned these perfectly, but if you encounter any...defects, tell me immediately." Afterwards Patchouli went to Sakuya to give her quite a few letters. "The invitations to the symposium on magic should reach their recipients immediately." When the maid raised her eyebrows at the recipients of some of the letters, Patchouli smirked and said "Trust me". The maid nodded and vanished, so Patchy sat down and returned to drinking tea with a smile. On her next visit, Marisa was going to get a lot more than she bargained for.<br>
<br>
---------<br>
Artifact Contest II: Augmented Magic<br>
<br>
So yeah, this contest will focus on the theme of Patchouli acquiring and making duplicates of Marisa's Mini-Hakkero. She also invites magicians and others that would be interested in magic to the Mansion. This contest will be a bit more strict than the last one, but I hope it's flexible enough to allow for quite a bit of variety in what scripters do.<br>
<br>
<br>
-Your script must be a stage.<br>
Patchouli gave copies of the Hakkero to some fairies. As such, a stage is required, so that this can be shown. Fairies shooting master sparks, using ridiculous patterns, and anything else that shows that they've been "augmented" is recommended. It technically doesn't have to be an actual stage script, but it must resemble one. <br>This means that it must have relatively weak enemies, a midboss, and a boss. Note that not every fairy has to have a Hakkero.<br>
<br>
<br>
-Your boss must have at least 3 nonspells and 3 spells. Your midboss(es) must have at least two lifebar segments (an individual attack is a segment)<br>
I think this is a pretty fair requirement. You can go over these limits, and in fact I think it would be a very good idea for you to do so.<br>
<br>
<br>
-Patchouli must be a boss and/or midboss.<br>
She wants to be involved in this, and also wants to try out the hakkero herself. To do this, she needs a target, like you. As such, she's required to fight the player at one point, but can at more than one point if you want.<br> She can be as annoying as Alice in PCB stage 2, be the stage boss, be a midboss, or anything in between. You only have to use her at least once.<br>
<br>
<br>
-Any other (mid)bosses MUST be chosen from one or more of these characters: Alice, Byakuren, Ran, Kisume, Parsee, Meiling, Sakuya, Remilia, Reimu, Eirin, Mokou, Sanae, Youmu, Nitori, Murasa, Satori, Iku, Tenshi, Kogasa, Tojiko, Futo**. <br>
<br>
Patchouli is holding a sort of convention for other magicians, as such these other magicians will be invited. Interestingly, a lot of people that aren't magicians showed up for this. I guess they're interested in magic...? The other residents of the SDM will also be present, sans Flandre. If you need a boss that isn't Patchouli, you must use one of the characters listed above.<br>
<br>
<br>
-Bosses must exhibit signs of having increased power.<br>
<br>
So, this is a really loose definition, but basically your bosses must actively use the Hakkero, at the very least in some spellcards. The wiki page (en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Mini-Hakkero) has some further information, but it essentially makes the character using it stronger.<br>
<br>
<br>
-You must require a Marisa player script.<br>
Make your own, ask the creator of one for permission. Regardless of which you choose, a Marisa player is mandatory. Be sure to balance your stage around this player. Marisa should NOT be firing master sparks since she doesn't have her hakkero. Make up something new or use something old. Please include the player script with your entry, since having people run around downloading stuff is a tad annoying.<br>
<br>
It can in fact be a player team with any other character, including fanmade ones. Just make sure Marisa is a part of it.<br>
<br>
<br>
-Have fun and don't stress yourself!<br>
This is a contest for your enjoyment. As such, relax and have fun with it. Winning isn't everything.<br>
<br>
Tentative Due Date: Friday, April 25th (45 days from now). Late entires might be accepted If I like you<br>
<br>
___<br>
*in regards to non-magical things. I'm sure she's careful when making magical bombs. I hope.<br>
**I literally randomly chose a bunch of extra touhous. Deal with it.<br>
<br>
<br>
Note: You do not have to draw ANYTHING holding a hakkero. You can use sprites of any sort. The DANMAKU just has to resemble hakkero usage.<br>
<br>
<br>
*Note: You do not have to use Danmakufu for this contest<br>
**This contest is open to all. For submission, please PM me (Sparen) with the download link and any updates to links. They will be archived in this post.<br>
