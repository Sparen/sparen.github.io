		<p>The Maidens of the Kaleidoscope subforum RaNGE, or Rika and Nitori's Garage Experiments, hosted some of the oldest Danmakufu contests and has had a long tradition of doing so, especially back with the first 10 contests. However, like all good things, the forum has slowly begun to decay and so backup logs for the contests are being stored here for posterity in case another apocalypse/500 Internal Server Error/Certificate Expiration/... occurs and causes the information to be lost.</p>

		<p style="font-family:monospace">Danmakufu Contest 1 - Halloween!<br>
<br>
Welcome to Rika's Garage's (grammatically questionable) first contest! Anyways, we all know that Halloween is just around the corner. There's nothing scarier than a wall of bullets heading right for you, so for this contest, you have to make a short Halloween themed boss fight! <br>
<br>
Rules:<br>
<br>
-The maximum number of attacks is 2 nonspells and 2 spells, with a matching plural script.<br>
-Have at least a normal difficulty version of the script, but you may have a hard/lunatic version included as well.<br>
-Feel free to use any resources necessary as long as credit is given, just don't blatantly steal ideas from other entries.<br>
-The boss character can be original, from Touhou, or from another game.<br>
-All entries must be linked to in this thread by midnight October 31st.<br>
-Don't discuss other people's entries in this thread until judging is complete.<br>
<br>
Judging:<br>
<br>
The judges will be me, Drake, Naut and Stuffman. 3 out of these judges will be picked for each entry (this allows the judges to enter too)<br>
Entries will be judged in the following categories:<br>
<br>
Design<br>
Is the difficulty genuine, or from random cheap shots? How fun is it to play? How original is your danmaku? Is it glitch free?<br>
<br>
Theme<br>
How well does it fit the contest theme?<br>
<br>
Style<br>
How well does the BGM match? How nice is it graphically? What extra touches are included?<br>
<br>
You can score up to 10 points in all of these categories, and your overall score will the total points earned.<br>
<br>
<br>
Don't be intimidated if you're new to danmakufu, everyone here has started off as an unknown user. I'm hoping to see some interesting entries! Good luck!<br></p>

		<p style="font-family:monospace">Yes, another one already - but don't worry, as the title implies, the subject matter is incredibly simple.<br>
<br>
RULES:<br>
- The only bullet type you are allowed to use is WHITE05. Lasers using WHITE05 are (edit:) NOT permissible.<br>
- You may have up to three spells.<br>
- Any kind of graphics, music, or other effects are permitted, but the only thing that is allowed to actually kill the player is WHITE05 (and of course the enemy's hitbox (don't abuse this)).<br>
<br>
JUDGING:<br>
- The judge is me! I will arbitrarily decide which three are my favorites. Numbers are subjective anyway. Obviously, I can't win, but I'll probably make some for chuckles anyway.<br>
- You will be judged purely on the quality of your danmaku, in terms of visual appeal and playability. Other bells and whistles are fine (and even recommended!) to make your script more fun, but you will be judged on your patterns alone.<br>
<br>
DEADLINE: 11/15/09, midnight EST. No exceptions. (That's next Sunday, for those of you that don't feel like checking your calendars.)<br>

Get crackin' PC-98 style, bros.</p>

		<p style="font-family:monospace">Survival Card<br>
<br>
Hey guys, it's been a while since we held our last Danmakufu contest, so I figured we should have another one. I discussed it with the guys on #danmakufu, and we decided to hold a contest to see who can make the best survival card. A survival card is a boss attack that you must time out in order to complete, the boss will take no damage from the player's shots or bombs.<br>
<br>
Rules and tips:<br>
Only one survival spellcard may be submitted.<br>
The spellcard must last no longer than 120 seconds, and may last less.<br>
You may include more than one pattern in the spellcard (like Mokou's Posessed by Phoenix), but it can be whatever you want, really.<br>
You may include a stage script for backgrounds and effects, but only for that purpose. No other enemies or attacks are allowed, save for whatever is in the one survival spellcard.<br>
You may include an event (talk script) if you want, but it will not be judged in any way. This is not a "write a story" contest, so keep it short if you include one.<br>
The script will be judged on how fun it is to play, how creative the bullet patterns are, and how creative you are with the concept of a survival card. Include difficulties if you need to, but the script will not be judged on difficulty unless it completely interferes with the playability of the script. That is, impossible to play or eye-gougingly easy. Don't suck up to me, either.<br>
If you're having trouble with some aspect of the contest, I will be in #danmakufu @ irc.ppirc.net, feel free to come get some advice or whatever.<br>
You may submit collaboration entries, be sure all people who helped you with the script are credited.<br>
You may use ripped sounds and graphics if you wish, I really don't care.<br>
If you're having trouble filling 120 seconds (or if it's a really boring 120 seconds), feel free to cut it down. You are not obligated to make a two minute spellcard. Quality over quantity.<br>
New people are welcome to submit entries, and are encouraged to do so! All entries will be judged equally.<br>
Be creative. Big points for doing really cool stuff.<br>
<br>
<br>
Your entry is due by Sunday, January 24th, at 23:59 GMT, no exceptions. I will be the only person judging. You may submit your entry in this thread or by PM, but your entry will inevitably be made public when I submit the scores. Please include your name somewhere in the script's #Title or #Text, so I won't be really annoyed while I play your script after searching for your submission post. <br>
<br>
Good luck!</p>

	      <h3 style="color:aqua">Danmakufu Contest 4 - Laser Light Show</h3>
		<p>Note: This is the backup log, originally hosted on the MotK forums. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.shrinemaiden.org/forum/index.php/topic,5038.0.html">Source</a></p>
		<p style="font-family:monospace">Laser Light Show<br>
<br>
Hey guys! Time for another contest! As the name implies it involves lasers. The main rule is you can only use lasers. This means no normal bullets.<br>
<br>
Guidelines:<br>
Up to 3 attacks can be submitted.<br>
You may use a stage for backgrounds, but only that. No stage enemies.<br>
Both straight and curvy lasers may be used.<br>
It is possible to make a laser that looks and behaves like a bullet. However, doing so is going against the point of this contest so doing so will result in disqualification. Basically when I play the script, I better not see small stubby lasers that could be mistaken as bullets.<br>
Script will be judged mainly on how fun and creative the danmaku is, but also a little on how the overall script looks and feels. Focus more on the danmaku though, that's worth more points.<br>
Multiple difficulties are allowed.<br>
Ripped graphics and sound are also allowed. No one really cares on this side of the world anyway.<br>
The latest version of the script will be considered your entry. If you submit an entry and then later want to correct a mistake or add effects, as long as the newer version is submitted before the deadline, it will be taken as your entry instead of the older one.<br>
And here's a big one: If I download your script and it errors out on me due to missing shot replace files, absolute file paths, or similar things, you will be disqualified during the judging period. If you submit before the deadline and I or someone else happens to notice before the contest closes, you can correct the mistake and resubmit it before the deadline and the script be judged like normal. I highly advise you to look at this tutorial to avoid being disqualified for this rule.<br>
<br>
I will be doing the judging. Contest closes on February 21nd, 2010 at 23:59:59 GMT. Any script not submitted by that timestamp according to this forum's clock will be disqualified. Please include your name somewhere in your script's description or title to help in organization and judging. In the spirit of the last two contests, I will also say that I may possibly submit an entry but will not judge it, but not submit one anyway.<br>
<br>
Good luck to all the entrants.<br>
<br>
Edit: The deadline has been extended for a week. The new deadline is February 28nd, 2010 at 23:59:59 GMT. Good luck on your entries.</p>

		<p style="font-family:monospace">Introduction<br>
After four contests we kind of came to a conclusion that creating interessting contests each time is quite a pain in the ass. That is why Blargel came up this time with an even (hopefully) more fun contest. As the title reads, you will be creating spell cards for the forgotten characters in Touhou. The rules show the list of allowed characters. Read them carefully. <br>
<br>
This contest will introduce divisions to give newcomers a chance to shine in the spotlights as well. Therefore two divisions will be available: Normal and Lunatic. Newcomers may choose to signup for Normal or Lunatic if they think they can handle it, but Experts are expected to sign up for Division Lunatic. Each division has its own judgement. Judging is going to be probably one of the biggest challanges in this contest. But it is worth the experiment. For this contest we will be having three judges: Helepolis (me), Blargel and a guest judge who will remain unknown. The unknown judge will bestow the judgement that counts twice as much as our judgement. This is all done to make it more exciting and more surprising. If we detect experts intentionally signing up for the lower division, we will disqualify that script. So think carefully in which division you belong. Read below to get an idea of the requirements:<br>
<br>
Division S: Lunatic ★★★★<br>
- You are quite expirienced with Danmakufu.<br>
- Functions and code is like the language you speak in real life.<br>
- We expect you to produce somewhat graphical content with relative clever mechanism<br>
<br>
Division C: Normal ★★<br>
- Newcomers or people with avarage expirience.<br>
- You understand the basics and perhaps somewhat advanced functions.<br>
- Graphical content and mechanism is not a problem if you cannot manage this.<br>
<br>
<br>
Rules ze!<br>
Below the rules are presented for this contest. They are bit lenghty this time, so my apologies in advance.<br>
<br>
To join: (Sign ups are closed)<br>
- Post a reply in the Sign up thread stating your nickname and what division you want to be in. Example: Helepolis division lunatic<br>
<br>
General<br>
- No custom player characters other than Danmakufu Reimu, Marisa and Naut's Sanae <br>
- We advice #Player[FREE], but if you wish you may force characters, as long as they are the ones mentioned in the previous rule.<br>
- Dialogues are allowed, but keep them reasonable.<br>
<br>
The content<br>
- Select one (1) boss: Daiyousei, Tokiko, Three Mischievous Fairies, Koakuma, Rinnosuke, Lily white/black or Akyu<br>
- If you select Rinnosuke, you should script a Rinnosuke. If we spot any signs of stupid Mannosuke fanon we will instantly disqualify you.<br>
- In case you selected three fairies, we expect you to create all three together.<br>
- Four (4) attacks allowed, but the maximum spell card limit is two (2). <br>
- Maximum one (1) survival card with a maximum of 90 seconds.<br>
- Obviously your script should be a plural or stage (in case of dialogues).<br>
- Multiple difficulties are accepted (Just keep it limited to Lunatic as maximum difficulty. No LuNAUTic or Flanchan.)<br>
- Write a small 'ZUN style' note on each spell card explaining the name and the card itself. (Think of Grimoire of Marisa)<br>
<br>
Disqualification<br>
Disqualification is not an amusing thing, we hope this doesn't occur, but keep in mind:<br>
- Your script should be "extract-and-play" style. We are NOT going to bother fixing your scripts. So test them proper for errors and playability.<br>
- Stealing bluntly other people's spell cards without permission is considered theft.<br>
- If we detect experts/experienced people inside the Normal division you will receive a scoring of 0,0.<br>
- READ THE HOW TO SUBMIT SECTION, Failing to meet up the requirements will lead to instant disqualification.<br>
<br>
<br>
How to submit<br>
- Upload your script somewhere where we can grab it without problems. http://bulletforge.org/ is a nice place to upload for supporting Blargel's work. (other alternatives: dropfox,mediafire,zshare). <br>
- Post your script INSIDE the division thread where you belong. Your post should contain:<br>
game type (stage or plural)<br>
name of your boss<br>
title of your game (if present)<br>
and a short description (mini plot) of the game.<br>
Grimoire of Marisa/ZUN style<br>
- I don't want essays/stories in your post explaining it. I want CLEAN posts.<br>
- Don't post multiple times, but EDIT your post to submit an update or new version. No cross-through editing, I want full post edits. Aka, ONE url for download.<br>
- You are free to modify your script until the closing deadline.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Yamas of this contest<br>
Three judges will be summoned this time for this contest, which two of them are known and one guest judge who will play a major role.<br>
<br>
Helepolis - Judgement score counts 1x <br>
Blargel - Judgement score counts 1x <br>
Mystery Youkai player - Judgement score counts 2x<br>
<br>
Each judge will give score on the scale: 0 - 10. The average from all three scores will be the final score. <br>
<br>
<br>
Deadline<br>
- Contest starts on 14th of March 2010 (on the day of Reitaisai)  <br>
- Deadline: 11th of april 2010 at 0:00 GMT+1<br>
<br>

		<p>Note: This is the backup log, originally hosted on the MotK forums. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.shrinemaiden.org/forum/index.php/topic,6456.0.html">Source</a></p>
		<p style="font-family:monospace">MotK's 6th Danmakufu Contest:<br>
<br>
Blinded by the Light!<br>
<br>
This contest has a predetermined list of graphics you are required to use. The graphics may be obtained here. Mirror.<br>
<br>
It may be obvious, but a shot sheet is a graphic. For this contest, you are required to use the shot sheet provided and no other bullets may be used, including the defaults. It is named c6shots.png, and the shot script is named c6shots.txt. There is an additional script included called c6shotguide.txt, it tells you what all the bullets are, and is a handy reference. There are 66 bullets in total, and they all share something in common...  :3<br>
<br>
The boss graphics and backgrounds are the other images provided. There are three different boss sprite sheets to choose from, totalling 5 possible bosses. You are not limited to using only one, and are not required to use all.<br>
<br>
<br>
And now with such gross limitations explained and out of the way, the rules and objectives:<br>
<br>
You may only use the graphics provided in c6.rar (get them here or here). All other graphical effects are not allowed. The only exceptions are Concentration01, Explosion01, and CutIn (and as a result, the default spellcircle).<br>
You may not use the default bullets (RED01, GREEN02, etc). You must use the bullets provided in c6.rar. Tampering with the shot declaration script included (c6shots.txt) is forbidden.<br>
You are to script up a boss fight consisting of no more than thee (3) spellcards and three (3) non-spell attacks. This can be a maximum total of 6 different "phases". You may include one survival spellcard, but it must be no longer than 60 seconds. You are not required to hit any of these caps, but going over is strictly forbidden.<br>
You may use a stage script to control your background if you prefer, though it is completely unnecessary. No other enemies except the boss may be spawned in the stage script (but if you like to spawn familiars as enemy scripts within the boss fight, you are allowed). Plural files are allowed and encouraged.<br>
You may use your own sound effects and music. They will not be judged heavily (if at all), so pick something you think suits the boss. As long as it isn't complete ear rape, it's all good.<br>
I recommend making at least two difficulties for your script, to ensure that everybody can enjoy your script equally. If you only make one difficulty and poorly balance it (very likely), you will be deducted score.<br>
MAKE SURE YOUR SCRIPT RUNS FLAWLESSLY BEFORE SUBMITTING IT. If your script unintentionally errors in some way (like missing shot replace scripts... Somehow), it will be disqualified. Your script should use relative path directories to ensure that it is playable no matter how it is extracted. If you're unsure whether your script will run on everybody's computer, download your own script from where you uploaded it, and try to play it in a different folder. This should catch most playability issues.<br>
If you somehow find any loophole in these rules that is obviously going against the point of the contest, please bring it up to me so I can fix it. Trying to exploit a loophole to give yourself an advantage will likely result in a disqualification. Ask if you're unsure about any of these rules.<br>
<br>
<br>
Your script is due Sunday, July 11th, 23:59 GMT. For those of you with lives, this means you have three weekends to work on your script. Please don't mess with the deadline, it's very annoying.<br>
<br>
<br>
Myself and Drake will be judging this contest. We'll be primarily looking at the enjoyability of the script. This mostly includes bullet pattern design and execution, as well as how pretty your script is (this is severely limited of course, so work within guidelines). We'll be judging pretty subjectively, but as fairly as we can possibly make it at the same time. It's hard to quantify every aspect of the script, so we'll be giving a total mark out of 24.7 which will determine your placement. We'll average our two scores, so the highest average mark wins the contest.<br>
<br>
Unlike contest #5, there will be no silly divisions or whatever else, and you aren't required to sign up. Anybody is allowed to enter. Post your entries in this thread, as well as any discussion or questions. I recommend using BulletForge for hosting a download of your script. INCLUDE YOUR NAME ON THE ENTRY SCRIPT SO WE KNOW IT IS YOURS. This is a pretty relaxed contest and there is a lot of room to wiggle around in, so take your time, have fun and create some great danmaku. Good luck!</p>

		<p style="font-family:monospace">It's finally time for our 7th Danmakufu contest:<br>
All Hallow's Even 2: Let's make a stage!<br>
<br>
That' right, people, it's that time again. Both for a new contest, and for Halloween. Since there was just so much positive feedback in regards to a stage contest, the Powers That Be decided it would be a good idea. This contest has a Halloween theme to it, and for the first time, we're going to make you guys create a whole stage. Enemy design, stage structure, moving backgrounds, you're all gonna have to push your abilities to the limits with this one.<br>
<br>
Judging this time around will be much different. This time around we'll have Community Voting. This means that instead of me judging all of your crap, anyone who wants to can play all the scripts, judge each one and give their scores (out of ten) with a short summary to me. I will tally up the scores and determine the winner based on this.<br>
<br>
<br>
Rules and tips:<br>
Scare people. It's Halloween you bastards, be creative. Surprise insta-kills are a bad thing though, don't do that.<br>
Stages are recommended to be at least 40 seconds long. This is a contest based on the whole stage, you don't need some piddly thing. In the same way, don't make it too long. I will slap you if it's PCB Stage 4 long.<br>
Bosses are recommended to have two nonspells and two spells. You cannot have any more, but you can have less. Having less just means less danmaku funtime for everybody.<br>
Midboss is optional. Two nonspells and one spell at max.<br>
Work on your background, sound effects and music choices. A good stage (especially a Halloween-centric stage) needs good synergy with its setting and theme; it shouldn't be boring for the player.<br>
Any scripts I find with errors popping up are disqualified. If people have trouble extracting it (i.e. you aren't using relative pathnaming or you have some dumb lib\shotsheet thing going on), also disqualified. Has to work out of the box.
I discourage giving extra score to an entry with super fandangled shiny graphics. Nice graphics is a great thing to have, but there is a difference between nice and "you didn't really need to make it that shiny". Spend more time on impressive danmaku and stages.<br>
Having two difficulties is recommended. Not all people play the same difficulty, so having only one difficulty poorly balanced is a big no-no. It isn't a must, but as your peers are judging you you'll want to be careful with balancing.<br>
<br>
Anyone can judge the scripts, even if they haven't entered, or even really know anything about danmakufu at all! (although really you should know a bit hopefully) Obviously, nobody can judge their own script.<br>
All your votes will be pruned through by yours truly. You should have solid reasons for giving someone a certain score, and if it looks as if there's a bias involved I'll call you out on it / throw it out.<br>
<br>
<br>
All scripts must be submitted by 11:59:59 PST (GMT-8), October 31. This means you have a whole two and a half weeks to work on this. Entries two seconds late will be accepted.<br>
All judgments must be submitted by 11:59:59 PST, November 6. Preferably much sooner.<br>
<br>

		<p>Note: This is the backup log, originally hosted on the MotK forums. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.shrinemaiden.org/forum/index.php/topic,8772.0.html">Source</a></p>
		<p style="font-family:monospace">The 8th Danmakufu Contest is now set to begin!<br>
  This Ain't Space Invaders!  <br>
<br>
What? Stagnancy, in MY RaNGE???? I can't let this stand. <br>
This is a contest in tribute to the very retro shmup games such as Space War!, Galaxian, Asteroids, and of course despite the title, Space Invaders. Also, to the danmaku line, as we are a Touhou forum after all.<br>
The object of this contest is to create a retroesque, yet danmaku, game in Danmakufu, entirely in one boss script. All of the game system, enemies, patterns, (and optional player and scoring system) must be programmed in this one script. In addition, I will be providing all graphics that are to be used in the 'game', as well as certain functions that should be adhered to.<br>
<br>
Once again, we will have Community Voting; partly because one person judging is slightly unfair, but mostly because I want to join as well. This means that instead of only me judging your works, anyone who wants to can play all the scripts, judge each one and give me their scores (out of ten) with a few phrases describing why they judged as they did. I will tally up the scores and determine the winner based on this.<br>
I count for two votes though dohohoho<br>
<br>
<br>
Rules and tips:<br>
As should be obvious, use only the graphics and such I give you. When you submit your script, you should need only submit the txt file, as everything else is provided and universal.<br>
To play your script, change the name of the primary script accordingly, then change the boss call line in the controller. You are going to want this controller to stay unchanged aside from that.<br>
Background stays black at all times. I would say "no add-blending", but as there are only black and white, it doesn't matter. Regardless, don't work around doing bullshit like RGB changing with effects.<br>
You really don't need 'flashy' effects. More emphasis goes on patterns and game design as a whole, not really incredible pixel explosions.<br>
Despite this, 'building' is permitted.<br>
Using the default Reimu and Marisa is allowed, but major points are awarded to those who go beyond the obvious and create a small game or their own system of sorts. Use the Insert Coin player if you plan to script your own (not inside the player; inside the boss script, of course!)<br>
As you will shortly find out through the provided functions, everything should ideally move 'pixel'-perfectly. Everything moves on exact 'pixels'.<br>
If you still haven't opened anything yet, 'pixels' are actually 2x2 pixel blocks. Screen resolution is 192x224, for all intents and purposes.<br>
Please!!!! submit useful functions specific to the contest restrictions if you think it will help other participants. I didn't include everything. These functions by themselves are only a starting point, I want to put an emphasis on community contribution.<br>
Speaking of which, in the DNH folder is a text file for bullet definition. But, it's nearly empty because I'm too lazy to do this all myself. Once you get going with your script, please post the contents of your definition file so I can update this post with a standard so everyone has the same one.<br>
Any scripts I find with errors popping up are disqualified, and if it doesn't work out of the box (why it wouldn't being one text file I have no clue), disqualified as well.<br>
Bonus for 8-bit music, not needed though. Sound effects? Eh, I guess that too.<br>
Having two difficulties is recommended. Not all people play the same difficulty, so having only one difficulty poorly balanced is a big no-no. It isn't a must, but as your peers are judging you you'll want to be careful with balancing.
RETRO! The theme of this contest is to keep it retro, so the less graphical blurs and general cleanliness, the better. Points are awarded for making it look authentic.<br>
<br>
Anyone can judge the scripts, even if they haven't entered, or even really know anything about danmakufu at all! Obviously, nobody can judge their own script.<br>
All your votes will be pruned through by yours truly. You should have solid reasons for giving someone a certain score, and if it looks as if there's a bias involved I'll call you out on it / throw it out.<br>
<br>
<br>
All scripts must be submitted by 11:59:59 PST (GMT-8), April 11. You have a bit more than two weeks. Entries two seconds late will once again be accepted.<br>
All judgments are accepted until a week afterwards, on the 18th.<br>

		<p style="font-family:monospace">Contest 9 - Perfect Memento in Self-insert Sense<br>
<br>
Welcome to Rika and Nitori's contest number 9. Now that August has arrived, it is time to stop slacking. I am sure most of you got a nice tan and been eating food non-stop the entire summer. Either way, it doesn't matter if you are ugly or beautiful, slim or fat. In this contest, you can be anything you want. Exactly! Welcome to 'Perfect Memento in Self-insert Sense' , a contest where self-insert is not punished by yelling, bashing and physical injuries. However, this contest will be held in Danmakufu Ph3 Beta. Just so we can make things a little more juicy. You will self-insert yourself, or an forum member into your script and come up with a "fitting" theme, profile and set of attacks. <br>
<br>
Objectives: <br>
- You must use Danmakufu Ph3 Beta. <br>
- Develop a Touhou Danmakufu script with a boss fight. You may script a stage/full game before the boss fight. <br>
- The boss must be a self-insert character. It must be you or a MotK forum member. (Ask the user for permission if you decide to insert a MotK member)<br>
- Boss fight length: up to max 3 non cards and 3 SC.  (Survival SCs may not last longer than 60s)<br>
- Optional: write a profile for the self-insert boss in the same style as Perfect Memento in Strict Sense. Not required but recommended.<br>
- In case you script a midboss: max 1 non-sc and sc<br>
<br>
<br>
Judgement<br>
The following parts of your script will be taken into judgement:<br>
- Gameplay, max 10 points. [70%]<br>
- Graphics, SFX, BGM, max 10 points. [15%]<br>
- Self-insert validation (is the boss profile + attacks "fitting" the user?) max 10 points. [15%]<br>
<br>
% of points summed == final score.<br>
<br>
Submission rules<br>
- Everybody can join, there is no sign up. Though obviously max 1 submission per person.<br>
- Your script must be compatible with standard 'Ph3 beta' installation.<br>
- Any custom libraries, scripts, images are your own responsibility for working correctly when extracting. <br>
- Upload your script in RAR or ZIP format and PM me the link. Make sure the download works after the deadline!<br>
- Very appreciated if you would use 'Contest 9 ..........' as PM header. So I don't have to dig around my inbox =3</p>

		<p style="font-family:monospace">Girls do their best now and are preparing.<br>
<br>
  Youkai Exterminator Extermination!  <br>
<br>
Oh my god a contest, how long it has been. I am very excite. We literally haven't had a contest held here in two years.
And what's with all these people coming out of nowhere? I wasn't even aware most of you existed. In any case, let's get started.<br>
<br>
The object of this contest is quite simple in scope and theme: you are to create a boss fight, picking from the "main" "heroines" of the Touhou series: Reimu, Marisa, Sakuya, Sanae, and Youmu. <br>
Naturally, the player will be a youkai.<br>
<br>
The judges this time around will be yours truly, and several secret judges that I haven't yet thought of will be revealed when the time comes. That being said, the judges are scoring each entry out of 24.7 possible points. I won't be using strict categories, but the general guideline is that gameplay, i.e. good pattern design and being fun to play, is more important than presentation and aesthetics. As usual.<br>
<br>
<br>
Rules and Tips:<br>
You may use Danmakufu 0.12m or ph3, although I heavily recommend ph3.<br>
You are to script up a boss fight consisting of no more than three spellcards and three noncards. Alternately, you could have a maximum of six different attack phases. You may include one survival spellcard, but it must be no longer than 60 seconds. You are not required to hit any of these limits, but going over is forbidden and dumb anyways.<br>
Putting more effort into the quality of what you have is better than padding with quantity. Likewise, having a survival spell should be alright on principle, but having the option to do it does not mean always it's a good idea.<br>
Staying thematic to the characters is a good idea, obviously. But playing and judging multiple scripts with Master Spark all over, as you can imagine, is not very enjoyable. If you do use a common character feature, try to make it fresh and exciting.<br>
I recommend making at least two difficulties for your script, to ensure that everybody can enjoy your script equally. If you only make one difficulty and poorly balance it (very likely), you may be deducted score for it.<br>
Despite saying above that we want to judge more on good design and fun/playability, having a well-polished fight and various nice bells and whistles is also bound to affect the fun and playability of your script.<br>
Please make sure your script runs flawlessly before submitting it. If your script unintentionally errors in some way, it will be disqualified, excusing only certain conditions. Your script should use relative path directories to ensure that it is playable no matter how it is extracted. If you're unsure whether or not your script will run on everybody's computer, download your own script from where you uploaded it, and try to play it in a different folder. This should catch most directory issues.<br>
<br>
<br>
As always, you aren't required to sign up, just make something and post it. Make sure it has your name and script version. In order to let people comment on the entries posted before the deadline, unless you need to fix an important error or something, consider your submissions as final. Lastly, I recommend using BulletForge to host your entry.<br>
<br>
All scripts must be submitted by 11:59:59 PDT (GMT-7), September 10. You have essentially two weeks. Entries two seconds late will be accepted.<br>
<br>

Halloween Contest!<br>
<br>
I just decided to make this, even though RaNGE10 just got over, but soon it's Halloween so there should be spooktacular scripts!<br>
This will be judged, but it shouldn't be too bad... right?<br>
<br>
-Minimum of one non-card and one spell. Easy. You can do more, but no more than 4 of  each.(4 non-card and 4 spells).<br>
-Must be dark. No rainbow backgrounds and smiley faces.(Rainbow danmaku is perfectly fine!).<br>
  -Halloween themed: disguises, things people would be scared of, and other Halloween-ish things will work.<br>
   -Even a joke script will work!<br>
-Any character will work, doesn't have to be a Touhou.<br>
-Keep in mind it has to be playable to MOST people.<br>
- Effects and Patterns are about the same in this, but patterns slightly out rules effects.<br>
<br>
Remember, this contest is nothing serious, it's just to have some coding fun for Halloween. <br>
<br>
<br>
Deadline will be November 1st , most of you will probably get done before, but the longer it is, the more points.<br>
Have fun~</p>

		<p>Note: This is the backup log, originally hosted on the MotK forums. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.shrinemaiden.org/forum/index.php/topic,16046.0.html">Source</a></p>
		<p style="font-family:monospace">Artifact Contest 1: The Pagoda of Bishamonten<br>
<br>
This contest will (hopefully) be one of many that involves artifacts from the Touhou series. This time, the artifact is the Pagoda of Bishamonten. Shou lost the Pagoda (again) and another character of your choice found it. The player must then retrieve it from said character, but the character doesn't want to give it up. So you fight for it.<br>
 <br>
- Must have at least three nonspells and three spells. Going over this limit is perfectly acceptable. You can make a stage or a series of bosses or a side scrolling shooter or StB or a freaking full game, just make it have at least three nonspells and three spells.<br>
- The character(s) must retain their identifying characteristics, while also doing something new due to the pagoda's power. <a target="_blank" href="http://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Jeweled_Pagoda_of_Bishamonten">The wiki page</a> has tidbits of information about what the Pagoda does. Common examples: Curvy lasers, bullets spawning where lasers intersect a wall. Be creative with your interpretation and you might come up with something new!<br>
- If you want to do multiple characters somehow, feel free to. It'll be rated as one entry, though. Make the circumstances make sense, like the characters continually taking the Pagoda from each other.<br>
- Shou and Nazrin aren't allowed Actually, you can use Nazrin as long as she doesn't have the pagoda. At all. Shou is probably too busy sulking to do anything, so she isn't allowed still.<br>
- Any game engine can be used. If you really want to make your own/have your own, feel free to utilize it.<br>
- Judging will be done by myself and possibly anyone else that wants to apply. Send me a message. If you want to participate, you can't be a judge, unfortunately. Scoring will be the average of all judge(s) scores, with entries rated on a scale of 1 to 10.<br>
<br>
Due date is to be decided, but it will definitely maybe be some time after January 1st.  This isn't really intended to be a major thing, so no need to use millions of effects and ensure that everything is flawless. Do your best and don't flip out.<br>
<br>
Edit: <br>
<br>
Due Date is  January 10th, 2014 at 11:59PM PST<br>
<br>
Entries two seconds late will be accepted. Also those two hours late. Maybe two days if I'm being nice. Try to have it in by the end of that weekend.<br>
<br>
Another Edit - Since people seem to have photoshop skills and everyone loves pagodas in cutins, here's an image of the pagoda by itself. Have fun. Credit to gtbot for this.</p>

~Girl are taking their leader's orders, please wait warmly~<br>
I think 2 months is a nice little time frame from the last contest to start a new one.<br>
<br>
<br>
What is this contest about?<br>
The servants and followers of Gensokyo are loyal to their leaders. Taking their orders day in and day out. Their leaders are everything to them and will do anything for them. They train with them and for them. It's time though that they are taken seriously!<br>
<br><br>

The Objective<br>
Your objective of this contest is to create a boss fight with a minimum of 3 non-cards and spells using a character who follows another character. Examples are:<br>
Youmu, Reisen, Orin, Okuu, Shou, Nazrin, Seiga, Futo. I'll explain this a little further below.<br>
<br>
Special Rules/Misc. Information<br>
- Any coding engine is welcomed, as long as it runs on Windows or works via wine. Danmakufu is preferred, but I realize not everyone wants to code in it. If you are coding it Danmakufu, either .12m or PH3 will work!<br>
<br>
-Characters must be official and follow a character that has appeared in the games/official works.<br>
<br>
-Characters must also include one spell that represents their master/leader.(The master/leader may appear in a spell to meet this requirement)<br>
<br>
-Valid contest characters include:<br>
Religious Followers: Futo, Shou, Murasa, Seiga, Soga, Nazrin, Ichirin. (These characters follow their respective leader: Byakuren and Miko)<br>
<br>
Slave/Servants/Workers: Sakuya, Youmu, Reisen, Komachi, Koakuma Chen, Ran, etc. (If you have a question, PM me about this.)<br>
<br>
Pets: Orin, Okuu, Tewi, Reisen Sakuya<br>
<br>
*The Chen and Reisen Clause*<br>
If a character has multiple masters/leaders or her master has a master(Chen's case), you can choose either one to make the spell off of. [Brownie points if you do a spell for both] (I mean if you have Reisen, you can make a spell that represents Kaguya or Eirin, and for Chen you can do either Ran or Yukari).<br>
<br>
I'm also leaving the "her master has a master" only to those with a master because I don't think Yoshika really follows Miko, she just takes orders from Seiga who just follows Miko, and Miko doesn't own her... if that makes sense. <br>
<br>
<br>
Deadline<br>
Tuesday May 6th<br>
<br>
<br>
Good luck and be sure to PM me with questions!</p>

Incident Causer Mayhem!<br>
<br>
Wee, another contest! This time starring... All the final bosses of the Touhou project!<br>
Let's just hop right into it.<br>
<br>
Objective:<br>
Recreate a boss fight against any final boss of the Touhou project.<br>
<br>
Rules:<br>
<br>
You must make the boss at least 2non/3 spellcards long, but cannot exceed 6nons/6spellcards long(Last Spells not included).<br>
NOTE: If your boss has a pattern that first starts as a nonspell and then transitions into a spell, it is considered a spell.<br>
<br>
Only one boss per script.<br>
NOTE: If you have a stage, you can have a midboss, the midboss will not count towards your nonspell/spell count, however it can only be a maximum of 1non/1spell long<br>
NOTE: You also cannot have a cameo of a boss(like Hourai Elixir)<br>
Konngara,Sariel, Mima, Yumemi, Yuuka, Shinki, Remilia, Yuyuko, Eirin, Kaguya, Suika, Eiki, Kanako, Tenshi, Utsuho, Byakuren, Miko, Kokoro and Shinmyoumaru are the only characters you can choose from.<br>
<br>
Reccomendations:<br>
<br>
Focus on patterns first, and effect later.<br>
Just because I said RECREATE doesn't mean rip off the spells of the boss, be ORIGINAL, but still true to the character<br>
Try to go for the maximum<br>
Dialogue is always fun, too, but is not needed<br>
Also have fun!<br>
<br>
Due date: NOVEMBER 10TH 2014<br>
Also, I haven't talked to my friend that usually judges with me in a long time, so I am looking for a judge to help.</p>

<br>
Stream will begin at 7:30 PM EST on February 19, 2015 and will be hosted at http://www.twitch.tv/sparenofiria<br>
Final updates to your scripts are due 24 hours after the end of the stream - 8:30 PM EST on Feb 20, 2015<br>
**Miransu will be joining in the stream with voice commentary!<br>
<br>
***Since 10 people have shown interest in participating, I have labelled this as RaNGE 13, assuming AAA and ICM to be RaNGE 11 and 12, respectively. <br>
<br>
Suddenly, all of Gensokyo woke up to quite an unusual phenomena! All of their abilities became the opposite of what they would normally be! Sakuya was making time flow (Credits: Sariel), Miko was suddenly deaf (Credits: Spectral Nexus), Parsee is suddenly happy with her life (Credits: Spectal Nexus), and Utsuho suddenly... does... uh... Nuclear Fission? (Credits: Trickysticks).<br>
<br>
Contest Description:<br>
-You must create a boss battle (see boss requirements below) with at least 3 nonspells and 3 spells. Having dual bosses is recommended but no longer required. Midbosses and stages do not count towards this total, although I suggest limiting a midboss (if you want one) to two attacks.<br>
-You must use ph3 [.1 pre6a] or later.<br>
-The boss(es) must use the exact opposite of their ability while still staying true to their danmaku style. You are not restricted to the scenarios above. Whatever crazy thoughts come to mind are perfectly fine.<br>
<br>
Restricted Bosses: You may not use the following bosses<br>
Prismriver Sisters<br>
Characters only appearing in PC-98<br>
<br>
Restricted Pairs: You can do any boss combination except for these<br>
Benben-Yatsuhashi<br>
Shizuka-Minoriko<br>
<br>
**Please choose bosses that have a legitimate opposite ability. -_-<br>
If your boss does exactly the same thing he/she would normally do in a danmaku battle, then points will be docked.<br>
<br>
Notes and Additional Rules:<br>
-Quality of Danmaku and usage of the boss(es) combining their flipped abilities in an original and creative fashion is what matters for judging<br>
-Effects are nice but are not as significant as above in terms of judging<br>
-There is no maximum number of attacks for the boss, but quality>quantity<br>
-No other enemies besides the two you have chosen may appear (with the exception of a mid boss)<br>
-Be as true to the characters' danmaku style as you can while... well... overturning what makes them what they are? I mean, if Sakuya can make time flow...<br>
-Have fun! The entire thing is as ridiculous as it can be regardless.<br>
-Meiling/Komachi players are not required. ^_^<br>
-You can cause as much chaos and utter destruction as possible as long as it is true to the character in some way and... preferably playable.<br>

		<p>Note: This is the backup log, originally hosted on the MotK forums. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.shrinemaiden.org/forum/index.php/topic,18639.0.html">Source</a></p>
		<p style="font-family:monospace">July X XXXX:<br>
Popularity seems to be thriving in Gensokyo once again. Though about 30 people, myself included, seem to be in this craze now. We'll just see how well these other 29 do against me... A list of participants will be including in this edition of Bunbunmaru News!<br>
<br>
Bunbunmaru's One and Only,<br>
             ~Aya Shameimaru<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
July X XXXX:<br>
Wow! Gensokyo is in a fever-pitch, I've never seen so many so many people fighting for glory! Me? Nah, I really don't feel like it... Even though my amazing camera skills would totally wow the crowds, but I'll keep you all in touch with all things in this popularity war!<br>
Your Modern Tengu,<br>
             ~Hatate Himekaidou<br>
<br>
<img src="./range14_banner.png"><br>
Yup! It's that time again! Contest time! As my lovely assistant Aya Shameimaru of the Bunbunmaru Newspaper has stated, you get to chose from 30 characters. The brings the question, what does that have to do with popularity... Well those 30 character are the top 30 characters in the 2015 popularity poll listen here With further ado, let's get into the rules.<br>
<br>
RULES:<br>
All main bosses must be within the top thirty of the popularity polls, no exceptions. *1<br>
The main boss fight must be at least 3 spells long and no longer than 6. *2<br>
Everyone in the group must do one boss, mid or main. *3<br>
The entry must be in version PH3 or other non-dnh engines capable of running across multiple OS's *4<br>
<br>
*1 Midbosses can be anyone.<br>
*2 Midboss not included, but try to keep that 1-2 spells long<br>
*3 You can collaborate with other! But each person has to contribute to the script a fair amount. Stage would also be included in this.<br>
*4 This is a hope to make people attempt to get into PH3, or extend out newer scripts in this engine, and seeing .12m is nearly dead at this point, this restriction doesn't seem too unreasonable. Also because one of out judges is a Mac user and for some reason .12m does not work out for him, so there's that. This is tentative, if we can find someone who can run .12m, .12m will for sure be an option to script in.<br>
<br>
TIPS:<br>
Patterns are number one! But be sure to balance it out with graphics and music.<br>
Try to keep the gameplay reasonable!<br>
Keep patterns and spell names true to the boss, you don't Ran shooting Reisen's pattern now do you?<br>
<br>
In case you missed the link for the top 30 here it is http://puu.sh/iSG9X/c30a97f6b5.png <br>
<br>
Ask any questions or concerns you may have.<br>
<br>
DEADLINE: JULY 31st<br>
Also looking for potential judges. Preferably with a Windows Operating System(I would, but I wanna participate, but if I don't feel like I'll finish it, I'll judge then.)<br>
<br>
<br>
Current Judges(Tentative; subject to change):<br>
TalosMistake<br>
ExPorygon<br>
Lunarethic<br>
<br>
A-Q<br>
Would multiple spells at once, with independent lifebars and scripts be counted as separate spells in the final count, or as one?<br>
Yes. The better phrase here would probably be "Spell Phase," or anytime there will be spell card(s) active.<br>
<br>
Do I/We HAVE to do a midboss/stage?<br>
Only if you're in a group. <br>
<br>
Will midbosses and stages be scored in the overall script?<br>
Yes. This will be an "extra credit" per se, but it can hurt you, however. <br>
<br>
Does the midboss have to be on the list?<br>
nope can be any Touhou character, official or fangame.</p>

		<p>Note: This is the backup log, originally hosted on the MotK forums. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.shrinemaiden.org/forum/index.php/topic,20892.0.html">Source</a></p>
		<p style="font-family:monospace">Yoo! I'm back and hosting more contests! <br>
For those that have been here on RaNGE for a long time, this contest will definitely bring you back. Lately, contests have been centered on characters or certain abilities. Well it's been a while since we've had a bullet restriction. It seems a lot of the people you have participated in the first Laser contest seems to have gone inactive and we have a lot more new and fresh scripters out there, so why not revisit this idea? <br>
<br>
Unfortunately, I don't have any fancy story for this, so I'll just get right to the guidelines <br>
<br>
<br>
Guidelines:<br>
   1) Lasers only! Loose, Straight, and Curvy Lasers<br>
      a) No familiar with hurtboxes(SetIntersectionToPlayer). These can be used as "fake bullets."<br>
      b) Do not make lasers act/look like bullets<br>
                c) You can use hitboxless bullets for aesthetic reasons<br>
<br>
   2) Must contain at least 2 patterns either as nonspells or spells. <br>
   <br>
   3) Scripters must work alone.<br>
<br>
   4) Patterns are the important part, do not worry about backgrounds, images, effects, or sounds. Just because the script looks flashy does not mean it's good.<br>
   <br>
   5) Any absolute pathing errors or missing files will lead to instant disqualification once the judging session as started. Please makes sure your scripts do not have these issues when you submit them.<br>
<br>
   6) You are allowed to resubmit entries as many times before the deadline. <br>
<br>
   7) Scripts submitted 2 seconds past the deadline will still be accepted, but only 2 seconds after the deadline.<br>
<br>
Deadline: July 16, 2017 </p>

		<p>Note: This is the backup log, originally hosted on the MotK forums. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.shrinemaiden.org/forum/index.php/topic,21068.0.html">Source</a></p>
		<p style="font-family:monospace">RaNGE 18 is here! To celebrate this contest series' coming of age, we have planned something a little...extra.<br>
 <br>
By extra we mean extra stages - this contest will cover any and all Extra bosses from main series Touhou games. This contest is designed to have a large pool of options to choose from so that people are bound to find something they enjoy. There aren't many restrictions beyond which character you can use, so have fun!<br>
<br>
RULES<br>
*All scripts must have a minimum of 6 patterns, with each nonspell or spell being one pattern.  To accommodate the fact that these are extra bosses, the maximum is 18 patterns. Please remember that quality beats quantity, though, and adding patterns for the sake of having more is discouraged.<br>
* Multiple difficulties are allowed. Judges are not obligated to play all difficulties and will likely pick one that matches their skill level, so be sure each one is balanced!<br>
* Midbosses and stages are optional. If a midboss is present it may have up to 3 patterns. Midbosses must be from the list below, but they don't need to "match" the boss they were assigned to in the official Touhou game.<br>
* Valid Bosses are Rika, Mugetsu, Gengetsu, Alice Margatroid, Flandre Scarlet, Ran Yakumo, Yukari Yakumo, Fujiwara no Mokou, Suwako Moriya, Koishi Komeiji, Nue Houjuu, Mamizou Futatsuiwa, Raiko Horikawa, Hecatia Lapizlazuli and Okina Matara. Mugetsu and Gengetsu need not be together.<br>
* Valid Midbosses are Mysterious Orb, Trump King, Patchouli Knowledge, Chen, Ran Yakumo, Keine Kamishirasawa, Kanako Yasaka, Sanae Kochiya, Kogasa Tatara, Nue Houjuu, Benben Tsukumo, Yatsuhashi Tsukumo, Doremy Sweet, Mai Teireida and Satono Nishida. Midbosses that appear together in the original game need not be together, and midbosses need not "match" the boss.<br>
* If done in Danmakufu or otherwise, script errors or other bugs may lead to docked points or complete disqualification depending on the severity of the issue. Be sure to thoroughly playtest!<br>

		<p style="font-family:monospace">Doors slide open and slam shut. Footsteps thud on the floor. One last door is thrown open, and an unknown intruder escapes Eientei, running into the night of the Bamboo Forest, A scream follows the intruder, countless rabbits giving up the chase as Reisen sinks to the ground. It's been a while since an incident like this, but...<br>
 <br>
Another artifact has been stolen!<br>
 <br>
This contest will be a continuation of the Artifact Contest series, in which contestants must design a boss fight that uses the gimmick(s) of another boss. This time, the artifact chosen belongs to Reisen Udongein Inaba, stage 5 boss of Imperishable Night. Be dazzled as bullets change places, rotate, and/or duplicate themselves, all while fading in and out of existence. All of these things and more can be made possible with the power of Reisen's Lunatic Gun. Or her ears.<br>
<br>
RULES<br>
*All scripts must have a minimum of 6 patterns and maximum of 12 patterns, with each nonspell or spell being one pattern. Please remember that quality beats quantity, though, and adding patterns for the sake of having more is discouraged.<br>
* Multiple difficulties are allowed. Judges are not obligated to play all difficulties and will likely pick one that matches their skill level, so be sure each one is balanced!<br>
* Midbosses and stages are optional. If a midboss is present it may have up to 3 patterns.<br>
* The only character that can't be a boss is Reisen (she can still be a player), everything else is fair game!<br>
* Please include the player that you used to test the script with the download package.<br>
* If done in Danmakufu or otherwise, script errors or other bugs may lead to docked points or complete disqualification depending on the severity of the issue. Be sure to thoroughly playtest!<br>

		<p style="font-family:monospace">It’s been a while since the last RaNGE contest, so I think it’s about time for contest #20. 20 contests in 10 years, woo!<br>
<br>
In many places winter is ending and spring is beginning. Shifting seasons are normal. <br>
<br>
In Gensokyo, though, life is anything but normal. Residents find themselves able to harness the power of the seasons once more, just like in Hidden Star in Four Seasons, but this time the seasons are really going haywire. Everywhere, all the time, the season changes within minutes! When the season changes, one’s abilities also change. <br>
<br>
The theme of this contest is to make a boss fight where the chosen character’s danmaku is influenced by the constantly-changing seasons. Just like in Okina's boss fight, your character will cycle through the four seasons.<br>
<br>
RULES<br>
<br>
* All scripts will have a minimum of 8 patterns, with each nonspell or spell being one pattern. This minimum is designed to accommodate one nonspell and one spell for each season.<br>
* All scripts will have a maximum of 17 patterns. This maximum is designed to accommodate someone who makes two nonspells and two spells for each season, plus a grand finale.<br>
* Multiple difficulties are allowed. Judges are not obligated to play all difficulties and will likely pick one that matches their skill level, so be sure each one is balanced!<br>
* Midbosses and stages are optional. If a midboss is present it may have up to 3 patterns. These 3 patterns don't count towards the pattern minimum or maximum.<br>
* Choosing Okina Matara as the boss character is not allowed. She may be present as a midboss as long as she follows the 3-pattern rule.<br>
* Having multiple bosses present is allowed. <br>
* Despite the usage of the word "script", entries do not need to be Danmakufu scripts. Entries can be made in any engine that you like, but keep in mind that it must at least be able to run on a Windows machine.<br>
* Regardless of the engine you use, game errors or other bugs may lead to docked points or complete disqualification depending on the severity of the issue. Be sure to thoroughly playtest!<br>
* Participants may work with up to one other person if they really want to. Both people will receive the same score.
* The relevant seasons are winter, spring, summer, and fall. The seasons need not be in that order. Seasonal danmaku is up to interpretation, but can be represented by playstyle differences and aesthetic changes.<br>

JUDGES<br>
Trickysticks, yeashie and CrestedPeak9<br>
<br>
Scripts will be judged with the majority of the score attributed to the quality of danmaku. Visual effects and music are nice, but they are ultimately secondary to your entry's gameplay. Since this is a themed contest, a part of your score will also be attributed to how well you follow the seasonal theme.<br>

		<p>As a Skype group (though it became a Discord group after Feb 10, 2016), the Land of Codes and Apertures never really had a place to store things, and when the Danmakufu Wiki admins decided to shut down the LOCAA pages, the backup logs for the first three contests were quickly retrieved and hosted on the Moriya Shrine -Extend- Forums. The forums were used to store the CURSE01 contest as well, and the information posts for the next two scripts were officially hosted there. However, on March 27, 2016, the owner of the forums and the staff came to a decision to close down the forums, and as a result, all of the details have been preserved here.</p>

<br>
The observed gimmick has been "create a boss fight for yourself as any Pokémon of your choice, with the exception of legendary Pokémon". <br>
There used to be a restriction of resources imposed as Miplouf had made a full set of graphics for the contest, but it is no longer required. <br>
The Legendary Pokémon rule is debatable as Sparen is a Suicune for the contest. <br>
Contest due date is June 12, 2013.<br>

Rules<br>
<br>
You MAY choose whichever version of Danmakufu to code in.<br>
Please package your chosen version of Danmakufu when submitting your script, to prevent problems of confusion and errors (ph3 only).<br>
You MAY NOT use gimmicks uncharacteristic of your chosen character. EX: Suika w/ Timestop.<br>
You MAY use patterns that are really beautiful and original. If your patterns satisfy both criteria, you're good to go. A bunch of shiny crap everywhere is -not- beautiful.<br>
You MAY make your script however long you want, but it must have a boss script at least 3 nonspells and 4 spells long. And you need to have a custom player, idc how simple. MADE BY YOU.<br>
You MAY NOT use a character that is not overrated. Seriously if you're gonna make a Wriggle boss fight, save it for a standalone project.<br>
You MAY discuss code with each other, but don't make it a team project. Otherwise, elimination.<br>
<br>
Rules of Integers~: <br>
- Deadline is now October 25th.<br>
- You now need 4 spells and nonspells<br>
- Last Spells count as 1 spell and nonspell<br>

Unlikely Pairs<br>
<br>
Rules<br>
-You must have a custom player character that is an unlikely pair. You may make multiple shot types, but the two characters you use must be the same.<br>
-Your bosses must also be an unlikely pair.<br>
-You may use either 0.12m or ph3. If you use ph3, you must state which version it is optimized for on Bulletforge.<br>
-This is not a team project. Each person must submit his or her own work, but code help is encouraged. Please cite code.<br>
-Since the feature of this contest is how the player character interacts with the bosses, you are required to balance your bosses to fit the specific character set(s) you have made.<br>
-You must have at least two difficulties, preferably one normal difficulty and one harder.<br>
-Neither the player characters nor the bosses may be original characters. They must be characters from the Touhou Project and must be on the list provided in the Excel Spreadsheet.<br>
-All danmaku and shot types must be serious and accurate of the player. You may not have whipped cream danmaku or anything of the sort (unless there's an existing Touhou Character that it fits?)<br>
-YOU MAY NOT USE MIMA. You may now use PC-98 characters, but they cannot be paired with another character that appears in the same game. Sakuya/Yumeko is banned.<br>
-Minimum 5 attacks total (average Stage 2 boss), maximum 15 attacks total (between the 10 of a Stage 6 and the 18 of an Extra). Stages not included, but mid bosses count towards this amount<br>

<br>
Mini-Hakkero Contest: Backstory and Guidelines<br>
<br>
We all know that Marisa is a thief. She's compulsive, focuses on power, and is most importantly, careless*.<br>
<br>
This carelessness is what will come back to haunt her.<br>
<br>
During one of her visits to the Scarlet Devil Mansion, she "borrowed" some books as usual, and left using the same method that she came with. By flying through the window, and while dodging danmaku. Patchouli sighed and went back to attempting to organize books left on the floor. From the corner of her eye, a glint caught her attention. "Hmm..."<br>
<br>
Marisa, relaxing after her heist, tried to feel for the mini-Hakkero in her pockets. It wasn't in her left, nor in her right, and after using some basic tracking magic, wasn't in her house at all. In fact, it seemed to be quite a distance away. Marisa wondered where she could have left it. The last time she had a use for it was when she...<br>
<br>
"Oh crap."<br>
<br>
Patchouli was instructing some fairies in the use of new artifacts. "So, you just use these as catalysts for what power you may have. I know I cloned these perfectly, but if you encounter any...defects, tell me immediately." Afterwards Patchouli went to Sakuya to give her quite a few letters. "The invitations to the symposium on magic should reach their recipients immediately." When the maid raised her eyebrows at the recipients of some of the letters, Patchouli smirked and said "Trust me". The maid nodded and vanished, so Patchy sat down and returned to drinking tea with a smile. On her next visit, Marisa was going to get a lot more than she bargained for.<br>
<br>
---------<br>
Artifact Contest II: Augmented Magic<br>
<br>
So yeah, this contest will focus on the theme of Patchouli acquiring and making duplicates of Marisa's Mini-Hakkero. She also invites magicians and others that would be interested in magic to the Mansion. This contest will be a bit more strict than the last one, but I hope it's flexible enough to allow for quite a bit of variety in what scripters do.<br>
<br>
<br>
-Your script must be a stage.<br>
Patchouli gave copies of the Hakkero to some fairies. As such, a stage is required, so that this can be shown. Fairies shooting master sparks, using ridiculous patterns, and anything else that shows that they've been "augmented" is recommended. It technically doesn't have to be an actual stage script, but it must resemble one. <br>This means that it must have relatively weak enemies, a midboss, and a boss. Note that not every fairy has to have a Hakkero.<br>
<br>
<br>
-Your boss must have at least 3 nonspells and 3 spells. Your midboss(es) must have at least two lifebar segments (an individual attack is a segment)<br>
I think this is a pretty fair requirement. You can go over these limits, and in fact I think it would be a very good idea for you to do so.<br>
<br>
<br>
-Patchouli must be a boss and/or midboss.<br>
She wants to be involved in this, and also wants to try out the hakkero herself. To do this, she needs a target, like you. As such, she's required to fight the player at one point, but can at more than one point if you want.<br> She can be as annoying as Alice in PCB stage 2, be the stage boss, be a midboss, or anything in between. You only have to use her at least once.<br>
<br>
<br>
-Any other (mid)bosses MUST be chosen from one or more of these characters: Alice, Byakuren, Ran, Kisume, Parsee, Meiling, Sakuya, Remilia, Reimu, Eirin, Mokou, Sanae, Youmu, Nitori, Murasa, Satori, Iku, Tenshi, Kogasa, Tojiko, Futo**. <br>
<br>
Patchouli is holding a sort of convention for other magicians, as such these other magicians will be invited. Interestingly, a lot of people that aren't magicians showed up for this. I guess they're interested in magic...? The other residents of the SDM will also be present, sans Flandre. If you need a boss that isn't Patchouli, you must use one of the characters listed above.<br>
<br>
<br>
-Bosses must exhibit signs of having increased power.<br>
<br>
So, this is a really loose definition, but basically your bosses must actively use the Hakkero, at the very least in some spellcards. The wiki page (en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Mini-Hakkero) has some further information, but it essentially makes the character using it stronger.<br>
<br>
<br>
-You must require a Marisa player script.<br>
Make your own, ask the creator of one for permission. Regardless of which you choose, a Marisa player is mandatory. Be sure to balance your stage around this player. Marisa should NOT be firing master sparks since she doesn't have her hakkero. Make up something new or use something old. Please include the player script with your entry, since having people run around downloading stuff is a tad annoying.<br>
<br>
It can in fact be a player team with any other character, including fanmade ones. Just make sure Marisa is a part of it.<br>
<br>
<br>
-Have fun and don't stress yourself!<br>
This is a contest for your enjoyment. As such, relax and have fun with it. Winning isn't everything.<br>
<br>
Tentative Due Date: Friday, April 25th (45 days from now). Late entires might be accepted If I like you<br>
<br>
___<br>
*in regards to non-magical things. I'm sure she's careful when making magical bombs. I hope.<br>
**I literally randomly chose a bunch of extra touhous. Deal with it.<br>
<br>
<br>
Note: You do not have to draw ANYTHING holding a hakkero. You can use sprites of any sort. The DANMAKU just has to resemble hakkero usage.<br>
<br>
<br>
*Note: You do not have to use Danmakufu for this contest<br>
**This contest is open to all. For submission, please PM me (Sparen) with the download link and any updates to links. They will be archived in this post.<br>

<br>
Fury of the Rivals<br>
<br>
Rules<br>
-You must have two bosses who are rivals in some shape or form. If you want to have more than two at any point, the logistical problems are for you to solve.<br>
-You may use either 0.12m or ph3. If you use ph3, you must state which version it is optimized for on Bulletforge.<br>
-This is not a team project. Each person must submit his or her own work, but code help is encouraged. Please cite code.<br>
-GetAngleToPlayer or any arctan used to calculate the angle to the player are Banned, with the exception of optional stage portions, effects, and the final spell card.<br>
-Player must be solo. The player should not be a team. You may have different shot types and the like, but do not have a two vs. two.<br>
<br>
Suggestions<br>
-You should have at least two difficulties, preferably one normal difficulty and one harder.<br>
-Follow the spirit of Mystical Chain. The two enemies are fighting against each other in-game, but the player is what matters. Make patterns that work well in both hitting the other enemy and hitting the player. Note that doing this is MUCH MUCH HARDER than you would think. <br>
-Remember: The player is being caught in the crossfire. Feel free to move the enemies around the screen or use Fullscreen.<br>
-Regarding ZUN/CtC sprites looking drunk since they look straight at the playerish: It's up to you how you want to deal with this.<br>
<br>
Notes<br>
-There are no length requirements. However, please don't do only one attack because that sort of defeats the point.<br>
-Effects, execution, etc. and how the contest will be graded are all up to the judges. Remember that quality > quantity.<br>
-You are not required to use Touhou Characters. You may use Original Characters or PC-98 characters if you wish.<br>

<br>
Somewhere in an alternate timeline, Sumireko’s plans to destroy the Hakurei Border have gone horribly right!  The Border has fallen and Gensokyo is now exposed to the outside world.  While Yukari begins making plans to reform the barrier, Reimu and the others must do damage control in the meantime.  Following the sudden emergence of a bizarre new area in Japan, various people from all across the world are now flocking to Gensokyo to investigate.  The incoming tide of newcomers must be held back by our heroines!<br>
<br>
RULES:<br>
You must create a danmaku boss battle featuring a character(s) from any other series besides Touhou Project.<br>
You may use any media (anime, TV show, manga, etc.) to draw inspiration from<br>
You may NOT use another Bullet Hell game, however!  Doing so will get you disqualified!  You’ve got tons of other options anyway, so just don’t do it~<br>
If you’re not sure if something qualifies as Bullet Hell, please check with the judges before you start working on your entry<br>
As much as it pains me to say this, original characters will not be allowed in this contest.  The point of this contest is to see how well you can translate a non-danmaku battle into a danmaku battle<br>
There is no restriction on player characters.  You can use whoever you want<br>
Minimum script length: 2 nonspells and 3 spell cards overall.<br>
Maximum script length: 6 nonspells and 6 spell cards overall.<br>
Stages are allowed.  You may also make midbosses/multiple bosses/cameo bosses/etc. so long as you fall within the minimum and maximum nonspell/spell card limits<br>
You are allowed one survival spell card<br>
No attack timer may exceed 60 seconds (including the survival)<br>
Last Words or Last Spells (that being spells that end the moment you die), as well as any patterns that go over the maximum limit, will be ignored in scoring<br>
You may use any game engine, not just Danmakufu, for this contest.  But whatever you use, please make sure that it’s functional and bug-free as possible<br>
You are allowed to work with a partner, but no more than teams of two.<br>
(Optional but HIGHLY recommended) Make at least two distinct difficulty settings for your script<br>
To clarify, you do not have to be in LOCAA to participate in this contest.  But if you aren’t, I would recommend joining the Discord group for it (Contact me, Sparen, GTbot, Ultima, etc. if you wish to join)<br>
<br>
JUDGEMENT CRITERIA:<br>
Creativity, challenge, and fun factor of the danmaku will be the primary focuses of judging<br>
Aesthetic appeal will be a minor factor.  Good danmaku with zero effects and animation will win out over poor danmaku with amazing graphical effects.<br>
Whether or not you animate your boss sprite will have no impact on score.  You could use a static .png image for all we care<br>
This doesn’t mean you should ignore aesthetics entirely though, but a little effort can go a long way.  Make sure that it doesn’t hurt our eyes to look at your script, for starters.<br>
Remember, you are to use the source material as “inspiration”, meaning you are free to take liberties with your script.  But also try to avoid drawing too heavily from the source if you’re porting a battle from another game.<br>
Remember that quality beats quantity!  Don’t needlessly pad out your script with patterns you don’t put much effort into.  Lazy patterns in an otherwise good script can hurt your score.  A short and sweet script is better than a long and boring script.<br>
Game-breaking bugs will result in an automatic zero.  Please playtest your scripts before the deadline!<br>
Submitting entries early may work to your benefit, as people can test your scripts and provide feedback.  In the interest of fairness, the judges won’t provide creative feedback until the deadline--but we’ll still notify you about potentially problematic bugs or easy fixes (like buggy danmaku or graphical glitches)<br>

		<p style="font-family:monospace">LOCAA Contest #8 - Pure Gensokyo!<br>
<br>
Deadline: July 3rd 23:59 GMT<br>
Entries 10 seconds late will be accepted<br>
<br>
After losing twice to the maidens of Gensokyo, Junko became interested in the power of Earth’s residents. Seeing it as an opportunity, Junko purified everyone she came across! Humans saw their potential unlocked, youkai reverted to their most primal forms, fairies once again became pure impurity. And just like every other incident, it was the perfect opportunity for danmaku!<br>
<br>
RULES:<br>
You must create a boss battle using a character who has appeared in an official touhou game. (Junko may not be used as a boss).<br>
A bullet can not be modified starting 1 frame after it has been fired.<br>
This prohibits changing speed, angle, velocity, etc. as well as changing graphic or size more than 1 frame after the bullet has spawned.<br>
It also prohibits functions like ObjMove_AddPattern and ObjShot_SetDeleteFrame with a time greater than 1.<br>
Starting 1 frame after a bullet has spawned, that bullet can not be used as a parameter for any functions. <br>
This includes ObjMove_GetX, ObjMove_GetAngle, GetAngleToPlayer, Obj_Delete and similar functions.<br>
DeletShotAll and DeleteShotInCircle are both prohibited, except at the end of a pattern (to clear the bullets for the next pattern).<br>
Emulating any of the “modifications” through any means is against the rules. So even if you don’t actually use ObjMove_GetX and ObjMove_GetY on a shot, if you spawn bullets that just so happen to be on that shot’s position every frame, that’s still against the rules. Just don’t be cheap =~=<br>
You can use both acceleration and angular velocity as long as they remain constant until the bullet is deleted.<br>
Any object that can pchuun the player or that the player can shoot ie considered a bullet, and must adhere to the above rules. Marisa’s GFW familiars are bullets. Raiko’s drums are bullets. Yoshika is a bullet.<br>
If an object can not pchuun the player, and the player can not shoot it, it is not considered a bullet. This includes hitbox-less familiars.<br>
The boss is also exempt from these rules.<br>
To summarize, you can change a bullet the frame it’s been spawned, but after that you can’t change it in any way.<br>
An exception to these rules are unique delay and delete effects. For those, finding a bullet’s position is allowed.<br>
Double bosses ARE allowed. For this to be valid, bosses must either share health or both bosses must be killed for a pattern to progress. For example, the Prismrivers and the Tsukumos are okay, while Seiga/Yoshika are not.<br>
Minimum script length: 2 nonspells and 2 spell cards.<br>
Maximum script length: 6 nonspells and 6 spell cards.<br>
Stages are allowed. During the stage portion only, all enemies are exempt from the bullet rules. You may make a midboss, but the midboss can not have more than 1 nonspell and 1 spell card.<br>
You are allowed 1 survival max.<br>
Last Words or Last Spells (that being spells that end the moment you die), as well as any patterns that go over the maximum limit, will be ignored in scoring.<br>
You may use any game engine, not just Danmakufu, for this contest. However, if you are not using danmakufu, please check with the judges prior to the deadline to make sure your engine works. <br>
You are allowed to work with a partner, but no more than teams of two.<br>
<br>
<br>
JUDGEMENT CRITERIA:<br>
Creativity, challenge, and fun factor of the danmaku will be the primary focuses of judging<br>
Aesthetic appeal will be a minor factor.  Good danmaku with zero effects and animation will win out over poor danmaku with amazing graphical effects.<br>
Remember that quality beats quantity!  Don’t needlessly pad out your script with patterns you don’t put much effort into.  Lazy patterns in an otherwise good script can hurt your score.  A short and sweet script is better than a long and boring script.<br>
Game-breaking bugs will result in an automatic zero.  Please playtest your scripts before the deadline!<br>
Submitting entries early may work to your benefit, as people can test your scripts and provide feedback.  In the interest of fairness, the judges won’t provide creative feedback until the deadline--but we’ll still notify you about potentially problematic bugs or easy fixes (like buggy danmaku or graphical glitches)<br>

<br>
Due Date: 9/3/16 12:00AM Central -6 GMT<br>
<br>
[Insert Lore Here]<br>
<br>
Rules:<br>
Each entry must have at-least 3 complete attacks and no more than 9 complete attacks. (Ex: 1 Non-spell and 2 Spells)<br>
Stages are allowed but are not required, you will not gain any points from including one.<br>
More than one boss battle is allowed as long as it satisfies rule no. 1.<br>
Double boss fights are allowed but are not required.<br>
Shinmyoumaru Sukuna is not allowed as a potential boss however she is allowed to appear in the entry. (Ex: During the ending dialogue)<br>
You may use a different engine than Danmakufu but your engine must be fully functional in order for your entry to be considered valid.<br>
Non Touhou bosses are allowed but not required. Original Characters included.<br>
<br>
<br>
Your entry MUST be fully functional BEFORE submission. <br>
<br>
I have provided a short checklist of things to do before you submit your entry.<br>
Remember to remove all cases of absolute pathing.<br>
	(Ex: "C:/Users/Me/Desktop/Photo.png")<br>
For dnh scripts, all required players must be included with the script.<br>
For any engine that is not dnh, all entries must have ALL of the required components in order for your engine of choice to run. This includes having redist installs and any dll libraries that it may need. Judges will not go out and fish for d3dx9.dll or any other missing components.<br>
Make sure any glitches present have been resolved before submission.<br>
Any special instructions needed for your entry should be included as well.<br>
<br>
Failure to follow any of the above rules mentioned can result in possible deduction of points or disqualification entirely. Do not take a chance, anything that is unclear here feel free to ask the host or any of the judges listed below.<br>
Host:<br>
Ultima<br>
Judges:<br>
ExPorygon<br>

Free<br>
Useful Tips:<br>
Remember this doesn't mean you have to copy Sukuna's boss battle in DDC. This contest is more about the Miracle Mallet as an object and less about how Sukuna herself used it.<br>
Remember that the mallet can enhance or alter items around it making them come to life or have multiple other unique uses. Use that to your advantage to come up with something unique and creative.<br>
	(Ex: Reimu's Purification Rod is affected by the Mallet's power)<br>
	(Ex 2: Seija's Nimble Fabric allowing her to become hidden from danmaku)</p>

		<p style="font-family:monospace">Len’en Contest 01<br>
Kill Two Birds With One Stone<br>
<br>
Summertime in Mugenri, and what’s a better way to have fun under the sun than to murder each other with bullets in all shapes and colors? But playing alone is dull, so the denizens of Mugenri decide to team up instead.<br>
<br>
RULES:<br>
You must create a script featuring two bosses in the style of Reactivate Majestical Imperial’s fourth stage.<br>
This means that each script will have at least one nonspell and one spell for each boss, plus at least one shared nonspell and spell, making the total minimum requirement three nonspells and three spells.<br>
The maximum amount of patterns is two nons, two spells for each boss and two shared nonspells and spells, putting the total limit for the script at six nonspells and six spells.<br>
Each pattern may not have a time limit greater than 70 seconds.<br>
You may not use any of the original pairings, which means Yabusame & Tsubakura, Yaorochi & Sukune and Kuroji & Saragimaru are prohibited and will result in disqualification. Please note that the individual characters themselves are not prohibited, just these specific combinations.<br>
Len’en characters only. Though, because we’ve barely seen anything of them, Jinbei would count as an OC and is therefore prohibited.<br>
Please include a player that is confirmed to flawlessly work with your script (i. e. it shouldn’t be too strong, neither too weak). A Len’en-themed player would be appreciated given the theme, but is not required. The player will not be taken into account for judging, unless it has major flaws impacting gameplay.<br>
Stages are allowed. If you plan on making a midboss, it is not necessary for it to be a dual boss. Maximum midboss length is three patterns of any kind.<br>
You are allowed to make, at most, one survival spell.<br>
Last Spells and Last Words (those being spells that end as soon as you get hit), as well as any spells exceeding the maximum limits will be ignored in scoring.<br>
You may use a game engine other than Touhou Danmakufu ph3, although it is the recommended one.<br>
You are allowed to work with a partner, but no more than teams of two.<br>
<br><br>
JUDGEMENT CRITERIA:<br>
Creativity, challenge and fun factor of the script will obviously be the main points of judging.<br>
Aesthetic appeal will be a minor factor, as good danmaku without effects will win out over poor danmaku with eye-dazzling effects.<br>
Quality over quantity! Do not create any more patterns than the minimum requirement if you can’t think of any good ones, as it may damage your score.<br>
Game-breaking bugs will result in an instant zero, so please, have another person or two test your script before the deadline.<br>
A criterion specific to this contest is how well the characters and their abilities compliment each other. A team spell that just has both characters shooting danmaku at the player will likely be graded worse than a team spell that combines both of their abilities and has them interact in some way.<br>

<br>
Deadline: April 2nd 23:59 EST<br>
Entries 14.8 seconds late will be accepted<br>
<br>
Taking a page out of Sumireko’s book, countless denizens of the outside world have begun their own “humaning away”. Gensokyo’s residents are disappearing left and right, being replaced by beings from all around the globe and beyond. Seeing this as a dangerous incident, our heroines decide to kick these uninvited guests out for good!<br>
<br>
RULES:<br>
You must create a danmaku battle featuring a character from a non-bullet hell series.<br>
All characters from bullet hell games are forbidden. If you’re not sure whether a game is considered a bullet hell, feel free to ask TresserT or the judges.<br>
Your boss can be from a game, a book, a show, anything so long as it is not from a bullet hell game.<br>
Characters that are not originally from a bullet hell, but feature in a canon game that is a bullet hell are still forbidden.<br>
The point is, there should be no danmaku for you to base your script on.<br>
Double/Triple bosses ARE allowed. <br>
Minimum script length: 2 nonspells and 2 spell cards.<br>
Maximum script length: 6 nonspells and 6 spell cards.<br>
Stages are allowed. You may make a midboss, but the midboss can not have more than 1 nonspell and 1 spell card.<br>
You are allowed 1 survival max.<br>
Last Words or Last Spells (that being spells that end the moment you die), as well as any patterns that go over the maximum limit, will be ignored in scoring. <br>
The minimums and maximums apply to the total number of patterns you want judged. If your script has more than one route, make sure there are at most 6 different nonspells and 6 different spells across all routes.<br>
You may use any game engine, not just Danmakufu, for this contest. However, if you are not using danmakufu, please check with the judges prior to the deadline to make sure your engine works. <br>
You are allowed to work with a partner, but no more than teams of two.<br>
You absolutely DO NOT need to be in locaa to participate in this contest.<br>
<br>
<br>
JUDGEMENT CRITERIA:<br>
Creativity, challenge, and fun factor of the danmaku will be the primary focuses of judging<br>
Aesthetic appeal will be a minor factor.  Good danmaku with zero effects and animation will win out over poor danmaku with amazing graphical effects.<br>
Sprites will not be factored into scoring. We realize how difficult it can be to find sprites of characters from non-shmups.<br>
Remember that quality beats quantity!  Don’t needlessly pad out your script with patterns you don’t put much effort into.  Lazy patterns in an otherwise good script can hurt your score.  A short and sweet script is better than a long and boring script.<br>
Game-breaking bugs will result in an automatic zero.  Please playtest your scripts before the deadline!<br>
Submitting entries early may work to your benefit, as people can test your scripts and provide feedback.  In the interest of fairness, the judges won’t provide creative feedback until the deadline--but we’ll still notify you about potentially problematic bugs or easy fixes (like buggy danmaku or graphical glitches)<br>

		<p style="font-family:monospace">LoCaA Contest #11: Perfect Possession Incident<br>
<br>
Deadline: February 19th, 2018 - 23:55 EST<br>
Late entries will not be accepted.<br>
<br>
It was just after the Occult incident...a new power called Perfect Possession sprung up in Gensokyo.  You know what that means: it’s time to fight with it!<br>
<br>
RULES:<br>
You must use two characters as your bosses, however they must swap between one another; meaning that both bosses can not be on-screen at the same time.<br>
It is recommended but not necessary that the bosses’ attacks interact with each other.  Take for example Jo’on’s second story spell card in AoCF; Jo’on creates a bunch of money bullets, and Shion sucks them up.<br>
If a character has a familiar of some kind (Yukari with Ran/Chen for instance) or something similar (i.e. Sumireko’s doppelgangers), this does not violate the two bosses at a time rule.  They are associated with the character that summoned them.<br>
Characters are restricted to official Touhou characters who appeared in games, however Jo’on and Shion Yorigami can not be used as bosses.  (Sorry Blue Mokou, you’ll get your chance someday)<br>
Minimum script length: 4 patterns<br>
Maximum script length: 12 patterns<br>
No stage segments nor midbosses (what kind of fighting game has stage portions anyway).  Using a Stage script is fine.
You may use at maximum 1 timeout/survival pattern.<br>
If there is/are any optional pattern(s) provided with the script (such as a Last Spell a la Imperishable Night) it will not be scored.  If you are to use a Last Word like in the fighters, it must be incorporated into the main boss fight to be scored.<br>
You may use any game engine, not just Danmakufu (in fact I encourage it!).  Keep in mind that if you are not using Danmakufu, you will have to check with the judges prior to the deadline to ensure that your engine works properly.  If your engine/script has a major game-breaking error, it will not be scored (this goes for Danmakufu too!)
You may work with a partner if you wish, but no more than a team of two (it would be blasphemous to not allow this in this contest)<br>
 Being a part of Land of Codes and Apertures is absolutely not required for this contest.  Join if you feel like joining!<br>
Have fun! Please don’t skip school to join a silly contest<br>
<br>
JUDGING CRITERIA:<br>
Creativity will be the primary focus of this contest, followed closely by fun factor and adequate challenge.  Make the best use of the Perfect Possession as you can!<br>
Aesthetic appeal will be a factor, albeit less than listed above.  Good but visually boring patterns will always beat terrible danmaku with flashy effects.<br>
Remember that quality beats quantity; patterns with a lack of effort will show on your score, whether the rest of your patterns are great or not.  If you don’t have a lot of ideas, it doesn’t hurt to make your script short but sweet.
As stated previously, any game-breaking errors will result in immediate disqualification...always be sure to playtest your script before you send it!<br>
Submitting an entry early has its advantages.  Judges can not provide creative feedback until the deadline for fairness, but if there is an easily avoidable error or something that will result in not getting judged, we will let you know.<br>

		<p style="font-family:monospace">LOCAA Contest #12 - Make the Old New<br>
<br>
Deadline: November 11, 23:59:59 GMT<br>
Entries like 6 hours late will be accepted (aka submit it by midnight est)<br>
<br>
Since it sounds like a good idea and it’s a great chance to see how much we’ve all improved, this contest will be about taking something old you’ve made and making it new! Or at least making it suck less.<br>
<br>
RULES<br>
You must create a script that is a “remake” of a script that you have previously made.<br>
If you’re remaking a script originally for a contest with a restriction, the remade script MUST also follow the contest’s restrictions.<br>
In order to make a comparison, you will have to submit the original script AND the newer script.<br>
Some scripts might not be available to download due to being super mega old and/or purged from existence. If a video exists, you can link that instead.<br>
Unreleased scripts are okay, since you’ll have to submit the unreleased script along with the new script. Just make sure that both work and be honest.<br>
It may be a good idea to pick an older script, or even your first ever script, as the differences will be more drastic.
To qualify as a remake, your entry should generally be of similar length to the original script. The patterns within should generally draw inspiration from the original patterns.<br>
You don’t have to exactly copy the length of the original work. If an idea is absolutely unworkable, it’s perfectly fine to omit it and/or replace it with something else. If you made an absurdly long script with repetitive patterns, it’s fine to cut some out. If you made an absurdly short script and want to add more to flesh it out, feel free to do so. It’s fine to change things.<br>
If you think a pattern you made doesn’t need many changes, don’t change it much.<br>
If you want to change the order of patterns or otherwise rearrange things, that’s totally fine. <br>
If you’re not using the default ExRumia player, please include the player script(s) with your entry. We don’t want to run around collecting players or guess which one we should use.<br>
Anything that was in the original script is allowed to be in this script. You can also only remake part of a script if you’d like, for example only remaking the boss portion of a stage.<br>
Despite the use of the word “script”, entries don’t need to be in Danmakufu. If you made something in 0.12m or whatever other engine, it’s perfectly fine to remake it in ph3 or LuaSTG or GameMaker or Unity or TaiseiScript or whatever you want. <br>
Partners are allowed if the original script was made with a partner. In that case, any of the original creators of the script can work together to create the new script too.<br>
If multiple people made the original and only a few people want to remake it, that’s perfectly fine.<br>
Anyone can join - you don’t have to be in LOCAA to submit an entry. Updates regarding the rules will be posted in LOCAA though, so you may want to check the contest document every now and then if you aren’t a member.<br>
<br>
JUDGEMENT CRITERIA<br>
As always, your creativity and how fun your script is will be factored in to your score.<br>
Since this is a contest about improvement, how much you’ve improved will be considered as a part of the scoring. <br>
As always, this event is more for fun than a serious competition. Don’t worry too much about your final score, and focus on using what you’ve learned to make things better.<br>
Make sure your things work. Submitting an entry only for it to throw errors will result in points being deducted or disqualification. Feel free to send your entries to a friend to see if it works.<br>

Judges: Koukou, om the nom, Tony64<br>
Welcome! Here, you will see everything on what’s been covered about the contest.<br>
<br>
Rules<br>
You must be a member of the Discord server “Unreal World of Mugenri” (join here). Not being a member means you cannot participate. Leaving the server at any moment without good reason or noticing any of the judges during the contest will have you automatically disqualified. No exceptions.<br>
You may work either individually or as a team of two. If you had extra help from someone who is not a part of your team for your script, please indicate that in a readme.txt and state what they have helped you with.<br>
Any evidence of you stealing or copying another participant’s script will have you disqualified.<br>
Do not torment another mod of the server about the contest (i.e. any of the priests or disciples). If you need to ask questions about the contest, please only talk to Koukou, om the nom or Tony64. The rest of the mods are not participating as judges.<br>
Diversity on boss choices is encouraged, try not to take the easy ways out with your character choices.<br>
You must choose 1 to 3 boss characters.<br>
Official Len’en characters only! Do not use Touhou characters or an OC.<br>
A familiar associated with the boss(es) or player character is still allowed.<br>
Duo bosses could be fighting together, or taking turns per spell. It’s up to you.<br>
You may use characters from Emergency Everyday if you desired (since it’s still technically Len’en), but not two certain phoneys.<br>
You cannot choose Tsurubami Senri as your boss character (or a fake like “Tsuzubami”)! This is because of the general theme.<br>
You will need to provide the player script that you used for balancing, for the fairness of the judging. It is heavily suggested that you stick to using Len’en player scripts. You may make your own player script for this contest as long as it is an official Len’en character.<br>
Spell patterns need to be original. We allow variants of spell cards to an extent.<br>
The difficulty levels are standard like an Extra Stage: Easy Extra, Extra and Absurdly Extra. If you are unable to make multiple difficulties, let the judges know.<br>
Any optional spells not connected with the boss fight will not be scored (e.g. a Last Spell). Make sure all your spells are casted by the same boss fight!<br>
No stage segments or midbosses! A boss fight is enough.<br>
Do not make the script memish; this is a serious contest! Leave memes to Zaro.<br>
Give credit to everything you use for your project in a readme.txt (e.g. JynX for using their game assets).<br>
You may use any engine you desire to create the script. Danmakufu isn’t the only thing! Just make sure to notify the judges beforehand.<br>
Submit before the provided deadline. Any submissions after will not be counted.<br>
You don’t have to be an advanced coder to participate! Even if your skills are basic, feel free to sign up!<br>

Spell Cards<br>
At least: 4 spell patterns and 2 non-spells.<br>
At most: 10 spells and 8 non-spells.<br>
There has to be at least one survival attack somewhere in your script.<br>
Optional: 1 spell card at max could be a variant of a boss’s official spell card. (Please indicate as such in the readme.txt.) *Just to add clarification, variant, while ultimately subjective, is being used here to refer to more direct references of a boss’s attacks. There’s obvious inspirations and there’s directly referencing how an actual card works and making slight alterations. This rule is not designed to limit your creativity, but rather provide you with the opportunity to make one referential attack if you so choose. Just don’t be a Haiji.<br>
All danmaku must contain monochromatic patterns (could still use coloured bullets), and monochromatic spell backgrounds (regular stage backgrounds exempt from this). The same colour gradient must be present throughout the entire battle. Black/white are included in a coloured monochrome scale too, so you can use those.<br>
In the case of multiple bosses, each boss must defer to a single monochromatic scheme throughout the entire battle. You may use more than one character and their respective colour in an attack though (so more than one monochromatic gradient is allowed in this instance only *applies to bg’s too).<br>
At least one pattern referencing Tsurubami. *does not count towards the earlier variant rule<br>
Plot Setting to Why Characters Can Use Monochromatic Danmaku<br>
Tsubakura was one day working in their lab at the Senri Shrine. They were mixing potions, but they at one point mixed the wrong chemicals, thus creating a huge explosion! The explosion created a massive black smoke that left the shrine for it to integrate within the clouds above. The clouds eventually rained an ink-like substance across Mugenri.<br>
Various Mugenrians see this as a great potential to use it to their advantage. They collect some of the rain to gain monochromatic-style Danmaku. With this, some gain the urge to try and become the next best leader, while others want to imitate the previous priest to stop trouble.<br>
Might not be much, but it’s something. Plot of what happens after this is up to your scripts.<br>
<br>
Judging Criteria<br>
The script will be judged by fun factor (8 points), creativity (8 points) and aesthetics (4 points) on each spell and non-spell pattern. The total will then be converted to a score out of 20.<br>
We’ll also be looking at sound, graphics and other details around the script in general (5 points).<br>
Each judge will give a final score out of 25, meaning a possible total score out of 75.<br>
Please value quality over quantity; a short but great script will get a better score than a long and boring one.<br>
Any major bugs that crashes the game will result in immediate disqualification. Always ensure to playtest your script before you send it!<br>
Submitting an entry early has its advantages. Judges cannot provide creative feedback until the deadline for fairness, but if there is an easily avoidable error or something that will result in not getting judged, we will let you know.<br>
<br>
