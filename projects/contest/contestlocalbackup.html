		<p>The Maidens of the Kaleidoscope subforum RaNGE, or Rika and Nitori's Garage Experiments, hosted some of the oldest Danmakufu contests and has had a long tradition of doing so, especially back with the first 10 contests. However, like all good things, the forum has slowly begun to decay and so backup logs for the contests are being stored here for posterity in case another apocalypse/500 Internal Server Error/Certificate Expiration/... occurs and causes the information to be lost.</p>

		<p style="font-family:monospace">Danmakufu Contest 1 - Halloween!<br>
<br>
Welcome to Rika's Garage's (grammatically questionable) first contest! Anyways, we all know that Halloween is just around the corner. There's nothing scarier than a wall of bullets heading right for you, so for this contest, you have to make a short Halloween themed boss fight! <br>
<br>
Rules:<br>
<br>
-The maximum number of attacks is 2 nonspells and 2 spells, with a matching plural script.<br>
-Have at least a normal difficulty version of the script, but you may have a hard/lunatic version included as well.<br>
-Feel free to use any resources necessary as long as credit is given, just don't blatantly steal ideas from other entries.<br>
-The boss character can be original, from Touhou, or from another game.<br>
-All entries must be linked to in this thread by midnight October 31st.<br>
-Don't discuss other people's entries in this thread until judging is complete.<br>
<br>
Judging:<br>
<br>
The judges will be me, Drake, Naut and Stuffman. 3 out of these judges will be picked for each entry (this allows the judges to enter too)<br>
Entries will be judged in the following categories:<br>
<br>
Design<br>
Is the difficulty genuine, or from random cheap shots? How fun is it to play? How original is your danmaku? Is it glitch free?<br>
<br>
Theme<br>
How well does it fit the contest theme?<br>
<br>
Style<br>
How well does the BGM match? How nice is it graphically? What extra touches are included?<br>
<br>
You can score up to 10 points in all of these categories, and your overall score will the total points earned.<br>
<br>
<br>
Don't be intimidated if you're new to danmakufu, everyone here has started off as an unknown user. I'm hoping to see some interesting entries! Good luck!<br></p>

		<p style="font-family:monospace">Yes, another one already - but don't worry, as the title implies, the subject matter is incredibly simple.<br>
<br>
RULES:<br>
- The only bullet type you are allowed to use is WHITE05. Lasers using WHITE05 are (edit:) NOT permissible.<br>
- You may have up to three spells.<br>
- Any kind of graphics, music, or other effects are permitted, but the only thing that is allowed to actually kill the player is WHITE05 (and of course the enemy's hitbox (don't abuse this)).<br>
<br>
JUDGING:<br>
- The judge is me! I will arbitrarily decide which three are my favorites. Numbers are subjective anyway. Obviously, I can't win, but I'll probably make some for chuckles anyway.<br>
- You will be judged purely on the quality of your danmaku, in terms of visual appeal and playability. Other bells and whistles are fine (and even recommended!) to make your script more fun, but you will be judged on your patterns alone.<br>
<br>
DEADLINE: 11/15/09, midnight EST. No exceptions. (That's next Sunday, for those of you that don't feel like checking your calendars.)<br>

Get crackin' PC-98 style, bros.</p>

		<p style="font-family:monospace">Survival Card<br>
<br>
Hey guys, it's been a while since we held our last Danmakufu contest, so I figured we should have another one. I discussed it with the guys on #danmakufu, and we decided to hold a contest to see who can make the best survival card. A survival card is a boss attack that you must time out in order to complete, the boss will take no damage from the player's shots or bombs.<br>
<br>
Rules and tips:<br>
Only one survival spellcard may be submitted.<br>
The spellcard must last no longer than 120 seconds, and may last less.<br>
You may include more than one pattern in the spellcard (like Mokou's Posessed by Phoenix), but it can be whatever you want, really.<br>
You may include a stage script for backgrounds and effects, but only for that purpose. No other enemies or attacks are allowed, save for whatever is in the one survival spellcard.<br>
You may include an event (talk script) if you want, but it will not be judged in any way. This is not a "write a story" contest, so keep it short if you include one.<br>
The script will be judged on how fun it is to play, how creative the bullet patterns are, and how creative you are with the concept of a survival card. Include difficulties if you need to, but the script will not be judged on difficulty unless it completely interferes with the playability of the script. That is, impossible to play or eye-gougingly easy. Don't suck up to me, either.<br>
If you're having trouble with some aspect of the contest, I will be in #danmakufu @ irc.ppirc.net, feel free to come get some advice or whatever.<br>
You may submit collaboration entries, be sure all people who helped you with the script are credited.<br>
You may use ripped sounds and graphics if you wish, I really don't care.<br>
If you're having trouble filling 120 seconds (or if it's a really boring 120 seconds), feel free to cut it down. You are not obligated to make a two minute spellcard. Quality over quantity.<br>
New people are welcome to submit entries, and are encouraged to do so! All entries will be judged equally.<br>
Be creative. Big points for doing really cool stuff.<br>
<br>
<br>
Your entry is due by Sunday, January 24th, at 23:59 GMT, no exceptions. I will be the only person judging. You may submit your entry in this thread or by PM, but your entry will inevitably be made public when I submit the scores. Please include your name somewhere in the script's #Title or #Text, so I won't be really annoyed while I play your script after searching for your submission post. <br>
<br>
Good luck!</p>

	      <h3 style="color:aqua">Danmakufu Contest 4 - Laser Light Show</h3>
		<p>Note: This is the backup log, originally hosted on the MotK forums. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.shrinemaiden.org/forum/index.php/topic,5038.0.html">Source</a></p>
		<p style="font-family:monospace">Laser Light Show<br>
<br>
Hey guys! Time for another contest! As the name implies it involves lasers. The main rule is you can only use lasers. This means no normal bullets.<br>
<br>
Guidelines:<br>
Up to 3 attacks can be submitted.<br>
You may use a stage for backgrounds, but only that. No stage enemies.<br>
Both straight and curvy lasers may be used.<br>
It is possible to make a laser that looks and behaves like a bullet. However, doing so is going against the point of this contest so doing so will result in disqualification. Basically when I play the script, I better not see small stubby lasers that could be mistaken as bullets.<br>
Script will be judged mainly on how fun and creative the danmaku is, but also a little on how the overall script looks and feels. Focus more on the danmaku though, that's worth more points.<br>
Multiple difficulties are allowed.<br>
Ripped graphics and sound are also allowed. No one really cares on this side of the world anyway.<br>
The latest version of the script will be considered your entry. If you submit an entry and then later want to correct a mistake or add effects, as long as the newer version is submitted before the deadline, it will be taken as your entry instead of the older one.<br>
And here's a big one: If I download your script and it errors out on me due to missing shot replace files, absolute file paths, or similar things, you will be disqualified during the judging period. If you submit before the deadline and I or someone else happens to notice before the contest closes, you can correct the mistake and resubmit it before the deadline and the script be judged like normal. I highly advise you to look at this tutorial to avoid being disqualified for this rule.<br>
<br>
I will be doing the judging. Contest closes on February 21nd, 2010 at 23:59:59 GMT. Any script not submitted by that timestamp according to this forum's clock will be disqualified. Please include your name somewhere in your script's description or title to help in organization and judging. In the spirit of the last two contests, I will also say that I may possibly submit an entry but will not judge it, but not submit one anyway.<br>
<br>
Good luck to all the entrants.<br>
<br>
Edit: The deadline has been extended for a week. The new deadline is February 28nd, 2010 at 23:59:59 GMT. Good luck on your entries.</p>

		<p style="font-family:monospace">Introduction<br>
After four contests we kind of came to a conclusion that creating interessting contests each time is quite a pain in the ass. That is why Blargel came up this time with an even (hopefully) more fun contest. As the title reads, you will be creating spell cards for the forgotten characters in Touhou. The rules show the list of allowed characters. Read them carefully. <br>
<br>
This contest will introduce divisions to give newcomers a chance to shine in the spotlights as well. Therefore two divisions will be available: Normal and Lunatic. Newcomers may choose to signup for Normal or Lunatic if they think they can handle it, but Experts are expected to sign up for Division Lunatic. Each division has its own judgement. Judging is going to be probably one of the biggest challanges in this contest. But it is worth the experiment. For this contest we will be having three judges: Helepolis (me), Blargel and a guest judge who will remain unknown. The unknown judge will bestow the judgement that counts twice as much as our judgement. This is all done to make it more exciting and more surprising. If we detect experts intentionally signing up for the lower division, we will disqualify that script. So think carefully in which division you belong. Read below to get an idea of the requirements:<br>
<br>
Division S: Lunatic ★★★★<br>
- You are quite expirienced with Danmakufu.<br>
- Functions and code is like the language you speak in real life.<br>
- We expect you to produce somewhat graphical content with relative clever mechanism<br>
<br>
Division C: Normal ★★<br>
- Newcomers or people with avarage expirience.<br>
- You understand the basics and perhaps somewhat advanced functions.<br>
- Graphical content and mechanism is not a problem if you cannot manage this.<br>
<br>
<br>
Rules ze!<br>
Below the rules are presented for this contest. They are bit lenghty this time, so my apologies in advance.<br>
<br>
To join: (Sign ups are closed)<br>
- Post a reply in the Sign up thread stating your nickname and what division you want to be in. Example: Helepolis division lunatic<br>
<br>
General<br>
- No custom player characters other than Danmakufu Reimu, Marisa and Naut's Sanae <br>
- We advice #Player[FREE], but if you wish you may force characters, as long as they are the ones mentioned in the previous rule.<br>
- Dialogues are allowed, but keep them reasonable.<br>
<br>
The content<br>
- Select one (1) boss: Daiyousei, Tokiko, Three Mischievous Fairies, Koakuma, Rinnosuke, Lily white/black or Akyu<br>
- If you select Rinnosuke, you should script a Rinnosuke. If we spot any signs of stupid Mannosuke fanon we will instantly disqualify you.<br>
- In case you selected three fairies, we expect you to create all three together.<br>
- Four (4) attacks allowed, but the maximum spell card limit is two (2). <br>
- Maximum one (1) survival card with a maximum of 90 seconds.<br>
- Obviously your script should be a plural or stage (in case of dialogues).<br>
- Multiple difficulties are accepted (Just keep it limited to Lunatic as maximum difficulty. No LuNAUTic or Flanchan.)<br>
- Write a small 'ZUN style' note on each spell card explaining the name and the card itself. (Think of Grimoire of Marisa)<br>
<br>
Disqualification<br>
Disqualification is not an amusing thing, we hope this doesn't occur, but keep in mind:<br>
- Your script should be "extract-and-play" style. We are NOT going to bother fixing your scripts. So test them proper for errors and playability.<br>
- Stealing bluntly other people's spell cards without permission is considered theft.<br>
- If we detect experts/experienced people inside the Normal division you will receive a scoring of 0,0.<br>
- READ THE HOW TO SUBMIT SECTION, Failing to meet up the requirements will lead to instant disqualification.<br>
<br>
<br>
How to submit<br>
- Upload your script somewhere where we can grab it without problems. http://bulletforge.org/ is a nice place to upload for supporting Blargel's work. (other alternatives: dropfox,mediafire,zshare). <br>
- Post your script INSIDE the division thread where you belong. Your post should contain:<br>
game type (stage or plural)<br>
name of your boss<br>
title of your game (if present)<br>
and a short description (mini plot) of the game.<br>
Grimoire of Marisa/ZUN style<br>
- I don't want essays/stories in your post explaining it. I want CLEAN posts.<br>
- Don't post multiple times, but EDIT your post to submit an update or new version. No cross-through editing, I want full post edits. Aka, ONE url for download.<br>
- You are free to modify your script until the closing deadline.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Yamas of this contest<br>
Three judges will be summoned this time for this contest, which two of them are known and one guest judge who will play a major role.<br>
<br>
Helepolis - Judgement score counts 1x <br>
Blargel - Judgement score counts 1x <br>
Mystery Youkai player - Judgement score counts 2x<br>
<br>
Each judge will give score on the scale: 0 - 10. The average from all three scores will be the final score. <br>
<br>
<br>
Deadline<br>
- Contest starts on 14th of March 2010 (on the day of Reitaisai)  <br>
- Deadline: 11th of april 2010 at 0:00 GMT+1<br>
<br>

		<p>Note: This is the backup log, originally hosted on the MotK forums. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.shrinemaiden.org/forum/index.php/topic,6456.0.html">Source</a></p>
		<p style="font-family:monospace">MotK's 6th Danmakufu Contest:<br>
<br>
Blinded by the Light!<br>
<br>
This contest has a predetermined list of graphics you are required to use. The graphics may be obtained here. Mirror.<br>
<br>
It may be obvious, but a shot sheet is a graphic. For this contest, you are required to use the shot sheet provided and no other bullets may be used, including the defaults. It is named c6shots.png, and the shot script is named c6shots.txt. There is an additional script included called c6shotguide.txt, it tells you what all the bullets are, and is a handy reference. There are 66 bullets in total, and they all share something in common...  :3<br>
<br>
The boss graphics and backgrounds are the other images provided. There are three different boss sprite sheets to choose from, totalling 5 possible bosses. You are not limited to using only one, and are not required to use all.<br>
<br>
<br>
And now with such gross limitations explained and out of the way, the rules and objectives:<br>
<br>
You may only use the graphics provided in c6.rar (get them here or here). All other graphical effects are not allowed. The only exceptions are Concentration01, Explosion01, and CutIn (and as a result, the default spellcircle).<br>
You may not use the default bullets (RED01, GREEN02, etc). You must use the bullets provided in c6.rar. Tampering with the shot declaration script included (c6shots.txt) is forbidden.<br>
You are to script up a boss fight consisting of no more than thee (3) spellcards and three (3) non-spell attacks. This can be a maximum total of 6 different "phases". You may include one survival spellcard, but it must be no longer than 60 seconds. You are not required to hit any of these caps, but going over is strictly forbidden.<br>
You may use a stage script to control your background if you prefer, though it is completely unnecessary. No other enemies except the boss may be spawned in the stage script (but if you like to spawn familiars as enemy scripts within the boss fight, you are allowed). Plural files are allowed and encouraged.<br>
You may use your own sound effects and music. They will not be judged heavily (if at all), so pick something you think suits the boss. As long as it isn't complete ear rape, it's all good.<br>
I recommend making at least two difficulties for your script, to ensure that everybody can enjoy your script equally. If you only make one difficulty and poorly balance it (very likely), you will be deducted score.<br>
MAKE SURE YOUR SCRIPT RUNS FLAWLESSLY BEFORE SUBMITTING IT. If your script unintentionally errors in some way (like missing shot replace scripts... Somehow), it will be disqualified. Your script should use relative path directories to ensure that it is playable no matter how it is extracted. If you're unsure whether your script will run on everybody's computer, download your own script from where you uploaded it, and try to play it in a different folder. This should catch most playability issues.<br>
If you somehow find any loophole in these rules that is obviously going against the point of the contest, please bring it up to me so I can fix it. Trying to exploit a loophole to give yourself an advantage will likely result in a disqualification. Ask if you're unsure about any of these rules.<br>
<br>
<br>
Your script is due Sunday, July 11th, 23:59 GMT. For those of you with lives, this means you have three weekends to work on your script. Please don't mess with the deadline, it's very annoying.<br>
<br>
<br>
Myself and Drake will be judging this contest. We'll be primarily looking at the enjoyability of the script. This mostly includes bullet pattern design and execution, as well as how pretty your script is (this is severely limited of course, so work within guidelines). We'll be judging pretty subjectively, but as fairly as we can possibly make it at the same time. It's hard to quantify every aspect of the script, so we'll be giving a total mark out of 24.7 which will determine your placement. We'll average our two scores, so the highest average mark wins the contest.<br>
<br>
Unlike contest #5, there will be no silly divisions or whatever else, and you aren't required to sign up. Anybody is allowed to enter. Post your entries in this thread, as well as any discussion or questions. I recommend using BulletForge for hosting a download of your script. INCLUDE YOUR NAME ON THE ENTRY SCRIPT SO WE KNOW IT IS YOURS. This is a pretty relaxed contest and there is a lot of room to wiggle around in, so take your time, have fun and create some great danmaku. Good luck!</p>

		<p style="font-family:monospace">It's finally time for our 7th Danmakufu contest:<br>
All Hallow's Even 2: Let's make a stage!<br>
<br>
That' right, people, it's that time again. Both for a new contest, and for Halloween. Since there was just so much positive feedback in regards to a stage contest, the Powers That Be decided it would be a good idea. This contest has a Halloween theme to it, and for the first time, we're going to make you guys create a whole stage. Enemy design, stage structure, moving backgrounds, you're all gonna have to push your abilities to the limits with this one.<br>
<br>
Judging this time around will be much different. This time around we'll have Community Voting. This means that instead of me judging all of your crap, anyone who wants to can play all the scripts, judge each one and give their scores (out of ten) with a short summary to me. I will tally up the scores and determine the winner based on this.<br>
<br>
<br>
Rules and tips:<br>
Scare people. It's Halloween you bastards, be creative. Surprise insta-kills are a bad thing though, don't do that.<br>
Stages are recommended to be at least 40 seconds long. This is a contest based on the whole stage, you don't need some piddly thing. In the same way, don't make it too long. I will slap you if it's PCB Stage 4 long.<br>
Bosses are recommended to have two nonspells and two spells. You cannot have any more, but you can have less. Having less just means less danmaku funtime for everybody.<br>
Midboss is optional. Two nonspells and one spell at max.<br>
Work on your background, sound effects and music choices. A good stage (especially a Halloween-centric stage) needs good synergy with its setting and theme; it shouldn't be boring for the player.<br>
Any scripts I find with errors popping up are disqualified. If people have trouble extracting it (i.e. you aren't using relative pathnaming or you have some dumb lib\shotsheet thing going on), also disqualified. Has to work out of the box.
I discourage giving extra score to an entry with super fandangled shiny graphics. Nice graphics is a great thing to have, but there is a difference between nice and "you didn't really need to make it that shiny". Spend more time on impressive danmaku and stages.<br>
Having two difficulties is recommended. Not all people play the same difficulty, so having only one difficulty poorly balanced is a big no-no. It isn't a must, but as your peers are judging you you'll want to be careful with balancing.<br>
<br>
Anyone can judge the scripts, even if they haven't entered, or even really know anything about danmakufu at all! (although really you should know a bit hopefully) Obviously, nobody can judge their own script.<br>
All your votes will be pruned through by yours truly. You should have solid reasons for giving someone a certain score, and if it looks as if there's a bias involved I'll call you out on it / throw it out.<br>
<br>
<br>
All scripts must be submitted by 11:59:59 PST (GMT-8), October 31. This means you have a whole two and a half weeks to work on this. Entries two seconds late will be accepted.<br>
All judgments must be submitted by 11:59:59 PST, November 6. Preferably much sooner.<br>
<br>

		<p>Note: This is the backup log, originally hosted on the MotK forums. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.shrinemaiden.org/forum/index.php/topic,8772.0.html">Source</a></p>
		<p style="font-family:monospace">The 8th Danmakufu Contest is now set to begin!<br>
  This Ain't Space Invaders!  <br>
<br>
What? Stagnancy, in MY RaNGE???? I can't let this stand. <br>
This is a contest in tribute to the very retro shmup games such as Space War!, Galaxian, Asteroids, and of course despite the title, Space Invaders. Also, to the danmaku line, as we are a Touhou forum after all.<br>
The object of this contest is to create a retroesque, yet danmaku, game in Danmakufu, entirely in one boss script. All of the game system, enemies, patterns, (and optional player and scoring system) must be programmed in this one script. In addition, I will be providing all graphics that are to be used in the 'game', as well as certain functions that should be adhered to.<br>
<br>
Once again, we will have Community Voting; partly because one person judging is slightly unfair, but mostly because I want to join as well. This means that instead of only me judging your works, anyone who wants to can play all the scripts, judge each one and give me their scores (out of ten) with a few phrases describing why they judged as they did. I will tally up the scores and determine the winner based on this.<br>
I count for two votes though dohohoho<br>
<br>
<br>
Rules and tips:<br>
As should be obvious, use only the graphics and such I give you. When you submit your script, you should need only submit the txt file, as everything else is provided and universal.<br>
To play your script, change the name of the primary script accordingly, then change the boss call line in the controller. You are going to want this controller to stay unchanged aside from that.<br>
Background stays black at all times. I would say "no add-blending", but as there are only black and white, it doesn't matter. Regardless, don't work around doing bullshit like RGB changing with effects.<br>
You really don't need 'flashy' effects. More emphasis goes on patterns and game design as a whole, not really incredible pixel explosions.<br>
Despite this, 'building' is permitted.<br>
Using the default Reimu and Marisa is allowed, but major points are awarded to those who go beyond the obvious and create a small game or their own system of sorts. Use the Insert Coin player if you plan to script your own (not inside the player; inside the boss script, of course!)<br>
As you will shortly find out through the provided functions, everything should ideally move 'pixel'-perfectly. Everything moves on exact 'pixels'.<br>
If you still haven't opened anything yet, 'pixels' are actually 2x2 pixel blocks. Screen resolution is 192x224, for all intents and purposes.<br>
Please!!!! submit useful functions specific to the contest restrictions if you think it will help other participants. I didn't include everything. These functions by themselves are only a starting point, I want to put an emphasis on community contribution.<br>
Speaking of which, in the DNH folder is a text file for bullet definition. But, it's nearly empty because I'm too lazy to do this all myself. Once you get going with your script, please post the contents of your definition file so I can update this post with a standard so everyone has the same one.<br>
Any scripts I find with errors popping up are disqualified, and if it doesn't work out of the box (why it wouldn't being one text file I have no clue), disqualified as well.<br>
Bonus for 8-bit music, not needed though. Sound effects? Eh, I guess that too.<br>
Having two difficulties is recommended. Not all people play the same difficulty, so having only one difficulty poorly balanced is a big no-no. It isn't a must, but as your peers are judging you you'll want to be careful with balancing.
RETRO! The theme of this contest is to keep it retro, so the less graphical blurs and general cleanliness, the better. Points are awarded for making it look authentic.<br>
<br>
Anyone can judge the scripts, even if they haven't entered, or even really know anything about danmakufu at all! Obviously, nobody can judge their own script.<br>
All your votes will be pruned through by yours truly. You should have solid reasons for giving someone a certain score, and if it looks as if there's a bias involved I'll call you out on it / throw it out.<br>
<br>
<br>
All scripts must be submitted by 11:59:59 PST (GMT-8), April 11. You have a bit more than two weeks. Entries two seconds late will once again be accepted.<br>
All judgments are accepted until a week afterwards, on the 18th.<br>

		<p style="font-family:monospace">Contest 9 - Perfect Memento in Self-insert Sense<br>
<br>
Welcome to Rika and Nitori's contest number 9. Now that August has arrived, it is time to stop slacking. I am sure most of you got a nice tan and been eating food non-stop the entire summer. Either way, it doesn't matter if you are ugly or beautiful, slim or fat. In this contest, you can be anything you want. Exactly! Welcome to 'Perfect Memento in Self-insert Sense' , a contest where self-insert is not punished by yelling, bashing and physical injuries. However, this contest will be held in Danmakufu Ph3 Beta. Just so we can make things a little more juicy. You will self-insert yourself, or an forum member into your script and come up with a "fitting" theme, profile and set of attacks. <br>
<br>
Objectives: <br>
- You must use Danmakufu Ph3 Beta. <br>
- Develop a Touhou Danmakufu script with a boss fight. You may script a stage/full game before the boss fight. <br>
- The boss must be a self-insert character. It must be you or a MotK forum member. (Ask the user for permission if you decide to insert a MotK member)<br>
- Boss fight length: up to max 3 non cards and 3 SC.  (Survival SCs may not last longer than 60s)<br>
- Optional: write a profile for the self-insert boss in the same style as Perfect Memento in Strict Sense. Not required but recommended.<br>
- In case you script a midboss: max 1 non-sc and sc<br>
<br>
<br>
Judgement<br>
The following parts of your script will be taken into judgement:<br>
- Gameplay, max 10 points. [70%]<br>
- Graphics, SFX, BGM, max 10 points. [15%]<br>
- Self-insert validation (is the boss profile + attacks "fitting" the user?) max 10 points. [15%]<br>
<br>
% of points summed == final score.<br>
<br>
Submission rules<br>
- Everybody can join, there is no sign up. Though obviously max 1 submission per person.<br>
- Your script must be compatible with standard 'Ph3 beta' installation.<br>
- Any custom libraries, scripts, images are your own responsibility for working correctly when extracting. <br>
- Upload your script in RAR or ZIP format and PM me the link. Make sure the download works after the deadline!<br>
- Very appreciated if you would use 'Contest 9 ..........' as PM header. So I don't have to dig around my inbox =3</p>

		<p>As a Skype group (though it became a Discord group after Feb 10, 2016), the Land of Codes and Apertures never really had a place to store things, and when the Danmakufu Wiki admins decided to shut down the LOCAA pages, the backup logs for the first three contests were quickly retrieved and hosted on the Moriya Shrine -Extend- Forums. The forums were used to store the CURSE01 contest as well, and the information posts for the next two scripts were officially hosted there. However, on March 27, 2016, the owner of the forums and the staff came to a decision to close down the forums, and as a result, all of the details have been preserved here.</p>

<br>
The observed gimmick has been "create a boss fight for yourself as any Pokémon of your choice, with the exception of legendary Pokémon". <br>
There used to be a restriction of resources imposed as Miplouf had made a full set of graphics for the contest, but it is no longer required. <br>
The Legendary Pokémon rule is debatable as Sparen is a Suicune for the contest. <br>
Contest due date is June 12, 2013.<br>
<br>
Ranking (from last to first):<br>
-Fonduemaster<br>
A Swampert boss fight. 4 nonspells and 6 spell cards.<br>
Danmakufu ph3 .0 pre11 is packaged with this script as it uses its own system script. (Fonduemaster did not want people potentially not being able to figure out where to put what portion of the script.)<br>
-Sparen (Sparen)<br>
A Suicune boss fight. 5 nonspells and 7 spell cards.<br>
Full of polar equations and curvy lasers<br>
Comes with a nonspell rush<br>
-banette (Miransu Uwabami)<br>
A Banette boss fight. 5 nonspells and 6 spell cards.<br>
Overrides almost everything that has been set as default by Danmakufu.<br>

Rules<br>
<br>
You MAY choose whichever version of Danmakufu to code in.<br>
Please package your chosen version of Danmakufu when submitting your script, to prevent problems of confusion and errors (ph3 only).<br>
You MAY NOT use gimmicks uncharacteristic of your chosen character. EX: Suika w/ Timestop.<br>
You MAY use patterns that are really beautiful and original. If your patterns satisfy both criteria, you're good to go. A bunch of shiny crap everywhere is -not- beautiful.<br>
You MAY make your script however long you want, but it must have a boss script at least 3 nonspells and 4 spells long. And you need to have a custom player, idc how simple. MADE BY YOU.<br>
You MAY NOT use a character that is not overrated. Seriously if you're gonna make a Wriggle boss fight, save it for a standalone project.<br>
You MAY discuss code with each other, but don't make it a team project. Otherwise, elimination.<br>
<br>
Rules of Integers~: <br>
- Deadline is now October 25th.<br>
- You now need 4 spells and nonspells<br>
- Last Spells count as 1 spell and nonspell<br>
- Last Words only count as half a spell<br>
- Survivals count the same.<br>
- Those who've changed your characters need to have a Last Word.<br>

<br>
Unlikely Pairs<br>
<br>
Rules<br>
-You must have a custom player character that is an unlikely pair. You may make multiple shot types, but the two characters you use must be the same.<br>
-Your bosses must also be an unlikely pair.<br>
-You may use either 0.12m or ph3. If you use ph3, you must state which version it is optimized for on Bulletforge.<br>
-This is not a team project. Each person must submit his or her own work, but code help is encouraged. Please cite code.<br>
-Since the feature of this contest is how the player character interacts with the bosses, you are required to balance your bosses to fit the specific character set(s) you have made.<br>
-You must have at least two difficulties, preferably one normal difficulty and one harder.<br>
-Neither the player characters nor the bosses may be original characters. They must be characters from the Touhou Project and must be on the list provided in the Excel Spreadsheet.<br>
-All danmaku and shot types must be serious and accurate of the player. You may not have whipped cream danmaku or anything of the sort (unless there's an existing Touhou Character that it fits?)<br>
-YOU MAY NOT USE MIMA. You may now use PC-98 characters, but they cannot be paired with another character that appears in the same game. Sakuya/Yumeko is banned.<br>
-Minimum 5 attacks total (average Stage 2 boss), maximum 15 attacks total (between the 10 of a Stage 6 and the 18 of an Extra). Stages not included, but mid bosses count towards this amount<br>

Effects, execution, etc. and how the contest will be graded are all up to the judges. Remember that quality > quantity.<br>

<br>
<br>
Mini-Hakkero Contest: Backstory and Guidelines<br>
<br>
We all know that Marisa is a thief. She's compulsive, focuses on power, and is most importantly, careless*.<br>
<br>
This carelessness is what will come back to haunt her.<br>
<br>
During one of her visits to the Scarlet Devil Mansion, she "borrowed" some books as usual, and left using the same method that she came with. By flying through the window, and while dodging danmaku. Patchouli sighed and went back to attempting to organize books left on the floor. From the corner of her eye, a glint caught her attention. "Hmm..."<br>
<br>
Marisa, relaxing after her heist, tried to feel for the mini-Hakkero in her pockets. It wasn't in her left, nor in her right, and after using some basic tracking magic, wasn't in her house at all. In fact, it seemed to be quite a distance away. Marisa wondered where she could have left it. The last time she had a use for it was when she...<br>
<br>
"Oh crap."<br>
<br>
Patchouli was instructing some fairies in the use of new artifacts. "So, you just use these as catalysts for what power you may have. I know I cloned these perfectly, but if you encounter any...defects, tell me immediately." Afterwards Patchouli went to Sakuya to give her quite a few letters. "The invitations to the symposium on magic should reach their recipients immediately." When the maid raised her eyebrows at the recipients of some of the letters, Patchouli smirked and said "Trust me". The maid nodded and vanished, so Patchy sat down and returned to drinking tea with a smile. On her next visit, Marisa was going to get a lot more than she bargained for.<br>
<br>
---------<br>
Artifact Contest II: Augmented Magic<br>
<br>
So yeah, this contest will focus on the theme of Patchouli acquiring and making duplicates of Marisa's Mini-Hakkero. She also invites magicians and others that would be interested in magic to the Mansion. This contest will be a bit more strict than the last one, but I hope it's flexible enough to allow for quite a bit of variety in what scripters do.<br>
<br>
<br>
-Your script must be a stage.<br>
Patchouli gave copies of the Hakkero to some fairies. As such, a stage is required, so that this can be shown. Fairies shooting master sparks, using ridiculous patterns, and anything else that shows that they've been "augmented" is recommended. It technically doesn't have to be an actual stage script, but it must resemble one. <br>This means that it must have relatively weak enemies, a midboss, and a boss. Note that not every fairy has to have a Hakkero.<br>
<br>
<br>
-Your boss must have at least 3 nonspells and 3 spells. Your midboss(es) must have at least two lifebar segments (an individual attack is a segment)<br>
I think this is a pretty fair requirement. You can go over these limits, and in fact I think it would be a very good idea for you to do so.<br>

<br>
-Patchouli must be a boss and/or midboss.<br>
She wants to be involved in this, and also wants to try out the hakkero herself. To do this, she needs a target, like you. As such, she's required to fight the player at one point, but can at more than one point if you want.<br> She can be as annoying as Alice in PCB stage 2, be the stage boss, be a midboss, or anything in between. You only have to use her at least once.<br>
<br>
<br>
-Any other (mid)bosses MUST be chosen from one or more of these characters: Alice, Byakuren, Ran, Kisume, Parsee, Meiling, Sakuya, Remilia, Reimu, Eirin, Mokou, Sanae, Youmu, Nitori, Murasa, Satori, Iku, Tenshi, Kogasa, Tojiko, Futo**. <br>
<br>
Patchouli is holding a sort of convention for other magicians, as such these other magicians will be invited. Interestingly, a lot of people that aren't magicians showed up for this. I guess they're interested in magic...? The other residents of the SDM will also be present, sans Flandre. If you need a boss that isn't Patchouli, you must use one of the characters listed above.<br>
<br>
<br>
-Bosses must exhibit signs of having increased power.<br>
<br>
So, this is a really loose definition, but basically your bosses must actively use the Hakkero, at the very least in some spellcards. The wiki page (en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Mini-Hakkero) has some further information, but it essentially makes the character using it stronger.<br>
<br>
<br>
-You must require a Marisa player script.<br>
Make your own, ask the creator of one for permission. Regardless of which you choose, a Marisa player is mandatory. Be sure to balance your stage around this player. Marisa should NOT be firing master sparks since she doesn't have her hakkero. Make up something new or use something old. Please include the player script with your entry, since having people run around downloading stuff is a tad annoying.<br>
<br>
It can in fact be a player team with any other character, including fanmade ones. Just make sure Marisa is a part of it.<br>
<br>
<br>
-Have fun and don't stress yourself!<br>
This is a contest for your enjoyment. As such, relax and have fun with it. Winning isn't everything.<br>
<br>
Tentative Due Date: Friday, April 25th (45 days from now). Late entires might be accepted If I like you<br>
<br>
___<br>
*in regards to non-magical things. I'm sure she's careful when making magical bombs. I hope.<br>
**I literally randomly chose a bunch of extra touhous. Deal with it.<br>
<br>
<br>
Note: You do not have to draw ANYTHING holding a hakkero. You can use sprites of any sort. The DANMAKU just has to resemble hakkero usage.<br>
<br>
<br>
*Note: You do not have to use Danmakufu for this contest<br>
**This contest is open to all. For submission, please PM me (Sparen) with the download link and any updates to links. They will be archived in this post.<br>

Fury of the Rivals<br>
<br>
Rules<br>
-You must have two bosses who are rivals in some shape or form. If you want to have more than two at any point, the logistical problems are for you to solve.<br>
-You may use either 0.12m or ph3. If you use ph3, you must state which version it is optimized for on Bulletforge.<br>
-This is not a team project. Each person must submit his or her own work, but code help is encouraged. Please cite code.<br>
-GetAngleToPlayer or any arctan used to calculate the angle to the player are Banned, with the exception of optional stage portions, effects, and the final spell card.<br>
-Player must be solo. The player should not be a team. You may have different shot types and the like, but do not have a two vs. two.<br>
<br>
Suggestions<br>
-You should have at least two difficulties, preferably one normal difficulty and one harder.<br>
-Follow the spirit of Mystical Chain. The two enemies are fighting against each other in-game, but the player is what matters. Make patterns that work well in both hitting the other enemy and hitting the player. Note that doing this is MUCH MUCH HARDER than you would think. <br>
-Remember: The player is being caught in the crossfire. Feel free to move the enemies around the screen or use Fullscreen.<br>
-Regarding ZUN/CtC sprites looking drunk since they look straight at the playerish: It's up to you how you want to deal with this.<br>
<br>
Notes<br>
-There are no length requirements. However, please don't do only one attack because that sort of defeats the point.<br>
-Effects, execution, etc. and how the contest will be graded are all up to the judges. Remember that quality > quantity.<br>
-You are not required to use Touhou Characters. You may use Original Characters or PC-98 characters if you wish.<br> 
<br>
Deadlines:<br>
The deadline is going to be July 21, 2014. Please plan in advance<br>
