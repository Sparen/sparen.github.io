Please note that these are ancient and that they are so old that I won't be providing links to them. These projects are collectively known as Phase 1.</p>
              <h2 style="color:aqua">Kogasa Player Script</h2>
              <p>Release Date: May 22, 2013</p>
              <p>Download Link: <a target="_blank" href="http://adf.ly/v80IS">Link (AdFly)</a></p>
              <p>As soon as my slate/to-do list was wiped clean of everything except for Pok&eacute;DigiDanmaku, I felt like working on a new player script. Turns out that this script ended up being my best player script in 0.12m and also has the distinction of being my primary 0.12m player script (KogasaA only). This is where I made my spritejob GOOD and gained confidence in my pixel art abilities.</p>
              <h2 style="color:turquoise">Touhou Terranean Cataclysm Extra Stage</h2>              <p>Release Date: April 2, 2013</p>
              <embed width="420" height="315"

              <p>For all practical purposes, this was my first real plural, and started out as a port but ended up being mainly changed. It featured my original character Suiroga, and was my official induction into the Danmakufu Community. It had some of my most (and least) memorable spellscards, and was the first script I received serious feedback on. There was a 'final' release March 14, 2013, and then a real final release April 2, 2014.</p>
              <h2 style="color:red">Utsuho Player Script</h2>
              <p>Release Date: March 7, 2013</p>
              <p>Download Link: <a target="_blank" href="http://adf.ly/v811X">Link (AdFly)</a></p>
              <p>At the time, Terranean Cataclysm seemed like it was actually going to happen, and so I ported my NetLogo TC players over into Danmakufu. Turns out that they were some of my first decent player scripts. Turned out to be the recommended (not really) player for TC Extra.</p>
              <h2 style="color:salmon">Introduction to Danmaku - Danmaku Dodging for Dummies</h2>              <p>Release Date: March 17, 2013</p>
              <p>Download Link: <a target="_blank" href="http://adf.ly/v816I">Link (AdFly)</a></p>
              <p>This script began on an international plane ride and exploded into my first real script meant for playing. It eventually died off, but its legacy remains - Trailing Wisteria, one of the best spellcards in the script, remains one of my best 0.12m spellcards. Although it was meant for beginner dodgers, I believe my ph3 version is more friendly. Original final version released sometime before March 2013, final release March 2013.</p>
              <h2 style="color:beige">BS Yukkuri Script</h2>
              <p>Release Date: January 30, 2013</p>
             <embed width="420" height="315"
		src="https://www.youtube.com/v/WIMN651LI6A"><br><br>
              <p>This unholy miscreation was my first stage script and was an extension of DDD that ended up being a test of Danmakufu 0.12m's built in point meter. No longer available.

              <h2 style="color:deepskyblue">PDD Veemon Player Script</h2>              <p>Release Date: Standalone: April 18, 2013; With Game: December 25, 2013</p>
              <p>After the horrific experience that was my Suiroga Player Script, I began planning for a Danmakufu port of Pok&eacute;DigiDanmaku, one of my NetLogo games that was put on indefinite hold due to switching my primary engine from NetLogo to Danmakufu. This player script survived through my UV/XY primitive object initiation, as well as some phases of my CommonData initiation, and over a long time, managed to become a fairly competent player script for Pok&eacute;DigiDanmaku. It is no longer available for download due to problems where PDD required a different version of the player. There were multiple 'final' releases, one in Jan 2013, another in Feb 2013, another in March 24, yet another in March 29, <i>another</i> release on April 18, and a final one on June 18.</p>              <h2 style="color:turquoise">Suiroga Player Script</h2>              <p>Release Date: Never Released; Completion Date: February 22, 2013</p>
              <p>My Suiroga Player Script was my very first player script in Danmakufu, and was my unholy initiation into Danmakufu 0.12m. Having no experience with making or working with graphics (my spritejobs were about as bad as they get), this project ended up being a major pain to make. However, I came out with some understanding of how to put stuff on the screen and make it move. In all honestly, I still don't understand why I didn't just make a normal plural script before going straight for the player...</p>              <br>            </div>          </div>        </div>      </div>      <div id="ft">        <p style="text-align: center;"><a href="#top">Top</a></p>        <p style="text-align: center;">Copyright Â© 2014 by Andrew Fan</p>        <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Other            Sites/Affiliates</span></p>        <div style="text-align: center;"><a target="_blank" href="http://www.winehq.org"><img              alt="&quot;Wine HQ&quot;"              src="../images/afflogowinehq.png"></a>          <a target="_blank" href="http://www.shrinemaiden.org/forum/index.php"><img              alt="&quot;Maidens of the Kaleidoscope&quot;"              src="../images/afflogomotk.png"></a>          <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bulletforge.org"><img alt="&quot;Bulletforge&quot;"              src="../images/afflogobulletforge.png"></a>          <a target="_blank" href="http://moriyashrine.weebly.com/index.html"><img              alt="&quot;Moriya Shrine&quot;"              src="../images/afflogomoriyashrine.png"></a>        </div>      </div>    </div>  </body></html>
