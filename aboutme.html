	      <h1 style="color:rgb(59,248,80)">About Me - More Professional Version</h1>
	      <p>My name is Andrew Fan, and I am a graduate of Stuyvesant High School and a current student at the Johns Hopkins University with a major in Computer Science.</p>
	      <p>Currently, my primary day-to-day language is Touhou Danmakufu, although I also use JavaScript (vanilla) on a regular basis for the various small tools I build. I'm also rather well-versed in Java. I have used Scheme and <a target="_blank" href="https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/">NetLogo</a> in the past, and I am familiar with basic C and C++. As of the time of writing, I am learning both Python and Ruby (moreso Python than Ruby).</p>
	      <p>My experience as a programmer began in Spring 2011, when I took Introduction to Computer Science at Stuyvesant High School. It was during that time that I learned Scheme and NetLogo, and when I began working on my first Touhou Project fangames. By the end of that summer, I had reached the limits of NetLogo, and I began working using Touhou Danmakufu 0.12m. It was in this time period that I expanded my knowledge and gained much of my experience.</p>
	      <p>In September 2013, I began learning Java in AP Computer Science AB, and I worked in Java alongside Touhou Danmakufu. By December, I had finished my first game in Touhou Danmakufu 0.12m, and, like many others in the community, moved on the the newer engine, ph3, which had significantly better support for Unicode, Meshes, Render Targets, and more recently, High Level Shader Language.</p>
	      <p>I am currently working on the SeitenTouji Project in Danmakufu ph3, and I am expanding my knowledge of Java, Javascript, Python, SVG, and other languages (programming and markup), frameworks, etc.</p>
	      <h1 style="color:rgb(59,248,80)">About Me - Internet Version</h1>
	      <p>I am Sparen of Iria, an intermediate-level scripter in Touhou Danmakufu and a moderator or former moderator of various online communities including but not limited to the Land of Codes and Apertures (current) and the Moriya Shrine Forums (former). I also do basic graphic and sound manipulation and am a self-taught artist, although my proficiency in this area is limited.</p>
	      <p>As a scripter in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.shrinemaiden.org/forum/index.php?board=9.0">RaNGE</a> on the Maidens of the Kaleidoscope Forums, I also help update the Danmakufu Wiki, am a collaborator for the Github repository of the Sublime Text Syntax Highlighter for Touhou Danmakufu ph3, and write tutorials and guides to assist newer and aspiring scripters.</p>
	      <p>I also have a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/SparenofIria">Youtube channel</a> where I feature the work of other Danmakufu scripters as well as my own. I have <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJ2F_5rhjlXTwCoPy9-5JSOufqAou908K">video tutorials for Danmakufu</a> uploaded there as well.</p>
