              <p>My name is Andrew Fan, and I am a graduate of Stuyvesant High School and a current student at Johns Hopkins University majoring in Biomedical Engineering. I hope to double major in Computer Science as well.</p>
              <p>I am currently fluent in English and Touhou Danmakufu, although I have used Scheme, NetLogo, and Java in the past (I am still using Java, but am not using it very often).</p>
              <p>My experience as a programmer began in Spring 2011, when I took Introduction to Computer Science at Stuyvesant High School. It was during that time that I learned Scheme and NetLogo, and when I began working on my first Touhou Project fangames. By the end of that summer, I had reached the limits of NetLogo, and I began working using Touhou Danmakufu 0.12m. It was in this time period that I expanded my knowledge and gained much of my experience.</p>
              <p>In September 2013, I began learning Java in AP Computer Science AB, and I worked in Java alongside Touhou Danmakufu. By December, I had finished my first game in Touhou Danmakufu 0.12m, and, like many others in the community, moved on the the newer engine, ph3, which had significantly better support for Unicode, Meshes, Render Targets, and more recently, High Level Shader Language.</p>
              <p>I am currently working on a project in ph3, and hope to learn C and C++ within the next year.</p>
