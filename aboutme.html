              <p>My name is Andrew Fan, and I am a graduate of Stuyvesant High School and a current student at Johns Hopkins University majoring in Biomedical Engineering. I hope to double major in Computer Science as well.</p>
              <p>Currently, my primary language is Touhou Danmakufu, although I have used Scheme, <a target="_blank" href="https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/">NetLogo</a>, and Java in the past (I am still using Java, but am not using it very often).</p>
              <p>My experience as a programmer began in Spring 2011, when I took Introduction to Computer Science at Stuyvesant High School. It was during that time that I learned Scheme and NetLogo, and when I began working on my first Touhou Project fangames. By the end of that summer, I had reached the limits of NetLogo, and I began working using Touhou Danmakufu 0.12m. It was in this time period that I expanded my knowledge and gained much of my experience.</p>
              <p>In September 2013, I began learning Java in AP Computer Science AB, and I worked in Java alongside Touhou Danmakufu. By December, I had finished my first game in Touhou Danmakufu 0.12m, and, like many others in the community, moved on the the newer engine, ph3, which had significantly better support for Unicode, Meshes, Render Targets, and more recently, High Level Shader Language.</p>
              <p>I am currently working on a project in ph3, and hope to learn C and C++ within the next year.</p>
              <h1 style="color:orange">About Me - Internet Version</h1>
              <p>I am Sparen of Iria, an intermediate-level scripter in Touhou Danmakufu and a moderator or former moderator of various online communities including but not limited to the Land of Codes and Apertures, and the Moriya Shrine Forums. I also do basic graphic and sound manipulation and am a self-taught writer and artist, although my proficiency in these is limited.</p>
              <p>As a scripter in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.shrinemaiden.org/forum/index.php?board=9.0">RaNGE</a> on the Maidens of the Kaleidoscope Forums, I also help update the Danmakufu Wiki, am a collaborator for the Github repository of the Sublime Text Syntax Highlighter for Touhou Danmakufu ph3, and write tutorials and guides to assist newer and aspiring scripters.</p>
              <p>I also have a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/SparenofIria">Youtube channel</a> where I feature the work of other Danmakufu scripters as well as my own. I have <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJ2F_5rhjlXTwCoPy9-5JSOufqAou908K">video tutorials for Danmakufu</a> uploaded there as well.</p>
