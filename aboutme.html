	      <h1 class="toplevelheaderb">About Me - More Professional Version</h1>
	      <p>I am Andrew Fan, a graduate of the Johns Hopkins University Whiting School of Engineering with a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science (May 2018) and a Masters of Science in Engineering in Computer Science (May 2019), as well as a graduate of Stuyvesant High School in New York City (Class of 2014).</p>
	      <p>My programming expertise is primarily focused in Full Stack Development with a focus on the middle-ground (API implementation) and backend. In addition, I have a significant focus in software development and engineering, as well as experience with Machine Learning in Python (PyTorch).</p>
	      <p>I have worked with a variety of programming languages, with a particular focus in Vanilla JavaScript, Java, and Python 3. Currently, my primary day-to-day languages are Touhou Danmakufu, JavaScript (vanilla), and Python 3, which I use on a regular basis for the various small tools I build. In the past, I have used Scheme/DrRacket and <a target="_blank" href="https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/">NetLogo</a>. Other languages I have utilized are C, C++, C# (in the context of Unity), OCaml, and Go.</p>
	      <p>My experience as a programmer began in Spring 2011, when I took Introduction to Computer Science at Stuyvesant High School. It was during that time that I learned Scheme and NetLogo, and when I began working on my first Touhou Project fangames. By the end of that summer, I had reached the limits of NetLogo for my personal usage, and I began working using Touhou Danmakufu 0.12m. It was in this time period that I expanded my knowledge and gained much of my experience.</p>
	      <p>In September 2013, I began learning Java in AP Computer Science AB, and I worked in Java alongside Touhou Danmakufu. By December, I had finished my first game in Touhou Danmakufu 0.12m, and, like many others in the community, moved on the the newer engine, ph3, which had significantly better support for Unicode, Meshes, Render Targets, and more recently, High Level Shader Language.</p>
	      <p>During my five years at the Johns Hopkins University Whiting School of Engineering, I took coursework in a variety of areas, including Computational Genomics, Computer Graphics, Databases, Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Object Oriented Software Engineering, Operating Systems, Parallel Programming, Programming Languages, and Video Game Design. I participated in a number of Hackathons in this time period and also produced a number of projects (UniText Xchange, etc) and video games (Spread the Löve, <a target="_blank" href="https://bluetabinteractive.tumblr.com">Project BLANK</a>, SeitenTouji Adamantine Memory Blade). I also worked with SVG in the context of wayfinding design, and created both tools and diagrammatic maps for public transportation wayfinding.</p>
	      <p>I am currently working on a number of projects (see the Projects Page) including the Metro Route Atlas and various Danmakufu utilities and scripts, and I am expanding my knowledge of Java, Javascript, Python, SVG, and other languages (programming and markup), frameworks, etc.</p>
	      <p>For a comprehensive list of projects I have worked on, refer to the 'Projects' page in the sidebar. For my (old) Public Transit maps, please refer to <a target="_blank" href="http://sparentransit.tumblr.com">Sparen's Transit Maps</a>.</p>
	      <h1 class="toplevelheaderb">About Me - Internet Version</h1>
	      <p>I am Sparen of Iria, an advanced-level scripter in Touhou Danmakufu and a moderator or former moderator of various Touhou/Bullet Hell focused online communities including but not limited to the Land of Codes and Apertures (current) and the Moriya Shrine Forums (former). I also do basic graphic and sound manipulation and am a self-taught artist and graphic designer, although my proficiency in this area is limited.</p>
	      <p>As a scripter in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.shrinemaiden.org/forum/index.php?board=9.0">RaNGE</a> on the Maidens of the Kaleidoscope Forums, I also help update the Danmakufu Wiki, am a collaborator for the Github repository of the Sublime Text Syntax Highlighter for Touhou Danmakufu ph3, and write tutorials and guides to assist newer and aspiring scripters. This includes the guides on this website, which also includes a sample style guide as well as a backup of the English language function reference for Touhou Danmakufu ph3.</p>
	      <p>I also have a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/SparenofIria">Youtube channel</a> where I feature the work of other Danmakufu scripters as well as my own. I have <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJ2F_5rhjlXTwCoPy9-5JSOufqAou908K">video tutorials for Danmakufu</a> uploaded there as well.</p>
