	      </div>              <h2 style="color:yellow" id="sub1">Part 1: What will be Covered in this Lesson?</h2>
	      <p>If you haven't realized by now, this lesson is about non-curvy lasers, which are reserved for the next lesson, where I will also discuss angular velocity in further detail. Here I will be discussing both loose lasers and straight lasers, as well as delay lasers.</p>
	      <p>Overall, this lesson will end up covering linear hitboxes and render width vs. hitbox width, among other things, and should provide adequate information for using lasers in Touhou Danmakufu ph3.</p>
              <h2 style="color:yellow" id="sub2">Part 2: What are Linear Hitboxes?</h2>
	      <p>Up to now, all the bullets we have discussed have had radial hitboxes - the hitbox of the bullet is calculated using the center of the bullet and a radius from that center. If the player's hitbox happens to overlap with the bullet's hitbox (or boss's hitbox, which is usually radial/circular), then the player enters a state where there is the option of deathbombing (depending on the player) before dying.</p>
	      <p>Unlike normal shots, lasers (of the loose and straight variety) use linear hitboxes. In these cases, there is a width to the hitbox, and it is calculated from the center axis of the laser. The overall shape of the hitbox is rectangular.</p>
	      <p>There are thing to watch out for, such as when the render width is very close to the hitbox width, which can result in narrow scrapes or accidental deaths. Be aware of this when playing with lasers.</p>
              <h2 style="color:yellow" id="sub2">Part 3: How do I Create and Use Loose Lasers?</h2>
	      <p>The first thing you will notice is that creating loose lasers is very easy, and is very similar to controlling shots. For all practical purposes, they are elongated shots with linear/rectangular hitboxes. There is one main function for creating them: <code>CreateLooseLaserA1()</code>. Its arguments are virtually the same as those of shots, except that it has length and width parameters. (length does not necessarily have to be greater than width, but that's sort of... well, up to the scripter). Note that for all lasers, the default blend is ADD - regardless of which graphic you choose, it will be rendered shiny. <b><span style="color:magenta">!!!FACT CHECK NEEDED - ADD_RGB or ADD_ARGB!!!</span></b></p>
	      <p>Below is an example that creates a loose laser. Note that for the graphic, it is best to choose a circular bullet as your base or a graphic meant specifically for lasers. Avoid using things such as fireballs (unless you are using the loose laser as a large bullet, in which case just make sure to scale the bullet correctly) and heart bullets for lasers.</p>
              <pre class="prettyprint"><code>    let obj = CreateLooseLaserA1(ObjMove_GetX(objBoss), ObjMove_GetY(objBoss), 3, GetAngleToPlayer(objBoss), 
        75, 18, 1025, 0);
    //The graphic I used, 1025, represents an ADD rendered round bullet from ExPorygon's AllStarShot shotsheet</code></pre>
	      <p>I explained above that you can use loose lasers for large bullets. In fact, this is a very popular technique for those who don't want to deal with manually setting the hitbox and scale of large custom bullets. All you need to do is create a loose laser whose dimensions are scaled properly from the actual bullet graphic. Do be aware though - the hitbox is rectangular and not circular, so it may have unwanted results with very large bullets.</p>
              <h2 style="color:yellow" id="sub4">Part 4: What are Straight Lasers?</h2>
	      <p>So I heard you want to create straight lasers! Great! First thing's first though - what exactly <i>is</i> a straight laser?</p>
	      <p>Above, I discussed loose lasers, which act as elongated bullets with linear/rectangular hitboxes as opposed to radial/circular ones. Straight Lasers, on the other hand, are stationary by default and have two interesting features to keep in mind - first, they are meant to delete at a certain time and second, they have delay, where a laser with no hitbox is spawned with a smaller width to show where the laser will spawn - this is important because when the delay time has run out, the laser will appear at full length.</p>
	      <p>Straight lasers can be created using the following code:</p>
              <pre class="prettyprint"><code>    let obj = CreateStraightLaserA1(ObjMove_GetX(objBoss), ObjMove_GetY(objBoss), GetAngleToPlayer(objBoss), 
        512, 20, 60, 1002, 60);
    //The graphic I used, 1002, represents an ADD rendered rectangular bullet from ExPorygon's AllStarShot shotsheet</code></pre>
	      <p>The arguments are as follows: <code>CreateStraightLaserA1(x, y, angle, length, width, delete time, graphic, delay);</code>, where delete time is how long the laser will last before automatically deleting - this timer begins after the delay period has finished. Note that for the length and width, I used 512 and 20, respectively, and used a rectangular bullet for the graphic. Generally speaking, it doesn't matter what graphic type you use, although it is best to use one that's as rectangular and undecorated as possible. I say rectangular because if you use a round bullet, the bullet graphic is stretched to the length and width, and there may be parts of the laser where there is a hitbox but the graphic is stretched in such a way where it seems like the location is safe (remember! Rectangular hitboxes! The hitbox of the laser does NOT match the graphic!). I say undecorated because the laser will be stretched, and any decorations will also be stretched, which is usually bound to result in something hideous.</p>
	      <p>As for the length and width, 512 is, being a power of 2, a standard number for laser length, assuring that the laser will stretch the entire length/width of the screen (technically speaking, from the top right to bottom left corner, you would want a laser of length &gt;= 590, but there are limited uses for that). I used 20 for width because anything under 18 has a high chance of having an invisible or near-invisible delay laser, which is always a bad thing. This is due to the render width of the delay laser being so thin that it may not correctly render. Of course, the laser will still spawn, often shocking the player. Keep this in mind if you are using purely horizontal or purely vertical lasers with widths &lt;= 20, as that is the scenario with the highest occurance of the render issue.</p>

	        <!--Quiz start.-->
		<p>1) In a shotsheet, a bullet graphic is 16x16 pixels. Later on, <code>ObjRender_SetScaleXYZ(obj, 0.5, 0.5, 1)</code> is called on the bullet. What should be done to make the hitbox of the bullet fair?</p>
