I chose it because it was one of the featured scripts on Bulletforge for a while and because it is one of the best individual scripts ever made in Danmakufu 0.12m (in my opinion).</p>

	      </div>              <h2 style="color:yellow" id="sub1">Part 1: What is Bulletforge?</h2>
	      <p>This tutorial assumes no prior knowledge of Danmakufu scripting, but assumes that you know how to play Danmakufu scripts. If you do not know what Danmakufu is, how to download it, or how to install scripts, I suggest reading <a href="./ph3u1l1.html">Unit 1 Lesson 1</a>. If you do not know how to run and use Danmakufu, I suggest reading <a href="./ph3u1l2.html">Unit 1 Lesson 2</a>.</p>
	      <p>If you haven't noticed yet, Bulletforge is linked in the footer of basically every page on the entire website. For quicker access for those unfamiliar with it, here is a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bulletforge.org">link</a>. Also, just so that it's easy to find, here is a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.shrinemaiden.org/forum/index.php/topic,12207.0.html">link</a> to the news thread on Maidens of the Kaleidoscope - it is not frequently updated, but it is still very useful for news on the website.</p>
	      <p>Anyways, Bulletforge is a site where Danmakufu scripters can upload their scripts for the world to see. It is run by Blargel, and he pays for hosting everything - please note that this means that you should be respectful to him and follow a set of general guidelines when using the site. There will be a list of things to be aware of later on in the tutorial. Bulletforge is meant for use by Danmakufu scripters only, however. It is not a place for you to host whatever you want to.</p>
              <h2 style="color:yellow" id="sub2">Part 2: How Do I Search for Scripts?</h2>
	      <p>By default, the search function will only search titles of scripts for words put into the box. Use the Advanced Search for more comprehensive searches.</p>
	      <p>You can also browse all projects. The Featured Project is, at the time of writing this, which of the last hundred scripts with the highest download votes. Most Downloaded is self-explanatory, but since the golden days of 0.12m and Bulletforge or over, it is unlikely that any project, even featured projects, will ever end up here nowadays. Highest Rated is based on upvotes - once again, very hard to get up here, although if legitimately done, has great rewards - mainly just the coveted front page space that the five highest get.</p>
	      <p>Finally, there is the 'Latest' tab, which lists scripts by release date. Once you fall off the top five, you lost a significant amount of traffic and must turn to other forms of advertisement to promote your script. Please note that the 'Updated Date' sort is dysfunctional, as it does not actually sort scripts by when a new version was made. Please do not use it - it is not helpful. Use Created Date when searching for scripts, and if you want to play really good scripts, high ratings and high download counts tend to sift out some of the less impressive scripts.</p>
	      <p>As a final note, you can click on a tag, but note that most people neglect to use helpful tags, so this is rarely, if ever, helpful.</p>
              <h2 style="color:yellow" id="sub3">Part 3: How Do I Download, Install, and Play Scripts?</h2>
	      <p>By pressing the download button on a script page, you can download the version of the script that the page is for. Click versions and click the topmost one to find the latest version of a script.</p>
	      <p>For installation and playing, please refer to <a href="./ph3u1l2.html">Unit 1 Lesson 2</a>. Also note that the Bulletforge description may contain helpful information, and if there is a ReadMe that comes with the script, it may be helpful to read it. Also, make sure that you are using the correct version of Danmakufu. 0.12m scripts will not run in ph3 and vice versa, and some ph3 scripts will not work in [.1], while others will require a newer version in order to function correctly.</p>
	      <p>Note that some scripts come with their own player scripts, and that other scripts come pre-packaged with Danmakufu. If it comes pre-packaged with Danmakufu, always run the copy of Danmakufu it comes with - do not put it into the script folder of your copy of Danmakufu. As for players, don't dump players included with a script into your general player folder, as they may require files located in the script.</p>
              <h2 style="color:yellow" id="sub8">Part 8: Unofficial Code of Conduct</h2>
	      <p>FOR ALL USERS:</p>
                <ul>
	          <li>Please do not post spam comments</li>
	          <li>Please do not spam downvotes to demotivate/insult/troll scripters. This is very bad for newer scripters, as they are the most prone to non-constructive criticism and it is easy for them to give up on Danmakufu after getting numerous downvotes, unaware that nobody really cares</li>
	          <li>Please do not use multiple accounts solely for the purposes of up/downvoting. Also do not pretend to be another scripter - we WILL report you and your duplicate account WILL be terminated.</li>
	          <li>Please do not mass-download the same script multiple times to knock up the download count. Someone did this on CURSE01 and some peoples' scripts were inflated by up to 200 illegitimate downloads. It did not cause immediate problems, but it confused a lot of people when they woke up with 200 extra downloads out of nowhere.</li>
	          <li>Please do not insult peoples' work unless there is a legitimate reason for it. Also, do not troll. Your comments are public and we will remember you.</li>
	          <li>If you wish to post a review, it is better to send the person a PM on MotK/Skype/wherever else if possible - we are not notified of comments on our scripts and there is a character limit for the comment box.</li>
	        </ul>
	      <p>FOR SCRIPTERS:</p>
                <ul>
	          <li><strong>Plagiarism is not tolerated by the Danmakufu Community.</strong> Always cite function libraries and code snippets you use, and never use someone else's danmaku, animation systems, backgrounds, or custom systems without their explicit permission.</li>
	          <li><strong>Please, please, PLEASE test your scripts in a clean copy of Danmakufu before uploading.</strong> <b>Always</b> include shotsheets and players inside the folder of your script. If your script errors on someone else's computer due to a file path error, it is very much your fault, and you will be prompted to fix it by other people who play your script.</li>
	          <li>Please do not upload scripts with .wav for bgm. By throwing an extra 50+ MB onto the download, you are just going to piss people off. Also, Blargel is paying for this, and you are sucking up memory and bandwidth.</li>
	          <li>Do not RARbomb, TARbomb, or ZIPbomb. Always have your script in a folder and then archive the folder. You can screw up someone's computer this way, and people will be pissed when whatever folder they unarchived your archive into explodes with files. Since Danmakufu scripts are meant to be packaged in folders since that is how you install scripts, do not RAR/TAR/ZIPbomb people. If you do not know what this is, look it up.</li>
	        </ul>
	      <p>FOR LETS PLAYERS AND VIDEO RECORDERS:</p>
                <ul>
	          <li>Always cite the download link without the 'v/v1' or whatever version number is used. This will automatically redirect to the latest version of a script. It will save you the pain of having to update the link, and is generally helpful for those trying to get the latest version of a script</li>
	          <li>If the scripter has a information post/thread for their script, please link to that as well.</li>
	          <li>Please make sure you state the name of the script and the person who made it somewhere in the title or description of your video. It'll make the videos easier to find and is generally good practice.</li>
	        </ul>
