              <p>This is a guide to Bulletforge by Sparen of Iria.</p>              <p>The video for this lesson is Hell's Famous Sisters by Miransu Uwabami. I chose it because it was one of the featured scripts on Bulletforge for a while and because it is one of the best individual scripts ever made in Danmakufu 0.12m (in my opinion).</p>

	      </div>              <h2 style="color:yellow" id="sub1">Part 1: What is Bulletforge?</h2>
	      <p>This tutorial assumes no prior knowledge of Danmakufu scripting, but assumes that you know how to play Danmakufu scripts. If you do not know what Danmakufu is, how to download it, or how to install scripts, I suggest reading <a href="./ph3u1l1.html">Unit 1 Lesson 1</a>. If you do not know how to run and use Danmakufu, I suggest reading <a href="./ph3u1l2.html">Unit 1 Lesson 2</a> as well.</p>
	      <p>If you haven't noticed yet, Bulletforge is linked in the footer of basically every page on the entire website. For quicker access for those unfamiliar with it, here is a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bulletforge.org" title="Bulletforge">link</a>. Also, just so that it's easy to find, here is a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.shrinemaiden.org/forum/index.php/topic,12207.0.html" title="Bulletforge news thread on Maidens of the Kaleidoscope Forums">link</a> to the news thread on Maidens of the Kaleidoscope - it is not frequently updated, but it is still very useful for news on the website.</p>
	      <p>Anyways, Bulletforge is a site where Danmakufu scripters can upload their scripts for the world to see. It is run by Blargel, and he pays for hosting everything - please note that this means that you should be respectful to him and follow a set of general guidelines when using the site. There will be a list of things to be aware of later on in the tutorial. Please do keep in mind that Bulletforge was designed as a place where Danmakufu scripters could share and distribute their work to the public. It is not a place for you to host whatever you want to.</p>
              <h2 style="color:yellow" id="sub2">Part 2: How Do I Search for Scripts?</h2>
<img alt="Bulletforge Front Page" height="400" width="640" src="http://i1164.photobucket.com/albums/q570/SparenofIria/ScreenShot2015-01-03at73449PM_zps1bebf303.png" border="0" alt=" photo ScreenShot2015-01-03at73449PM_zps1bebf303.png"/><br><br>
	      <p>By default, the search function will only search titles of scripts for words put into the box. Use the Advanced Search for more comprehensive searches.</p>
	      <p>You can also browse all projects. The Featured Project is, at the time of writing this, which of the last hundred scripts with the highest download votes. Most Downloaded is self-explanatory, but since the golden days of 0.12m and Bulletforge or over, it is unlikely that any project, even featured projects, will ever end up here nowadays. Highest Rated is based on upvotes - once again, very hard to get up here, although if legitimately done, has great rewards - mainly just the coveted front page space that the five highest get.</p>
	      <p>Finally, there is the 'Latest' tab, which lists scripts by release date. Once you fall off the top five, you lost a significant amount of traffic and must turn to other forms of advertisement to promote your script. Please note that the 'Updated Date' sort is dysfunctional, as it does not actually sort scripts by when a new version was made. Please do not use it - it is not helpful. Use Created Date when searching for scripts, and if you want to play really good scripts, high ratings and high download counts tend to sift out some of the less impressive scripts.</p>
	      <p>Personally, I check Bulletforge a few times a day - usually, there are no new scripts. However, scripts pop up very often during contest times, so keep an eye out for those.</p>
	      <p>As a final note, you can click on a tag, but note that most people neglect to use helpful tags, so this is rarely, if ever, helpful.</p>
              <h2 style="color:yellow" id="sub3">Part 3: How Do I Download, Install, and Play Scripts?</h2>
	      <p>By pressing the download button on a script page, you can download the version of the script that the page is for. Click versions and click the topmost one to find the latest version of a script.</p>
	      <p>For installation and playing, please refer to <a href="./ph3u1l2.html">Unit 1 Lesson 2</a>. Also note that the Bulletforge description may contain helpful information, and if there is a ReadMe that comes with the script, it may be helpful to read it. Also, make sure that you are using the correct version of Danmakufu. 0.12m scripts will not run in ph3 and vice versa, and some ph3 scripts will not work in [.1], while others will require a newer version in order to function correctly.</p>
	      <p>Note that some scripts come with their own player scripts, and that other scripts come pre-packaged with Danmakufu. If it comes pre-packaged with Danmakufu, always run the copy of Danmakufu it comes with - do not put it into the script folder of your copy of Danmakufu. As for players, don't dump players included with a script into your general player folder, as they may require files located in the script.</p>
              <h2 style="color:yellow" id="sub4">Part 4: What Details are Present on a Script Page?</h2>
<img alt="Bulletforge Project Example" height="217" width="487" src="http://i1164.photobucket.com/albums/q570/SparenofIria/ScreenShot2015-01-03at74240PM_zps3e4ad169.png" border="0" alt=" photo ScreenShot2015-01-03at74240PM_zps3e4ad169.png"/><br><br>
	      <p>On a script page, there are a number of helpful and interesting things.</p>
	      <p>Under the Details tab, there are various pieces of information, such as the person who made the script (as well as a link to their Bulletforge project list), the type of script, Danmakufu version (important!), tags, and update date (unreliable). There is also a space for up and downvoting, as well as the download link and stats on downloads for the current version (listed next to the name of the script) and votes. There is also a box for description text - always read this, since they may specify how to play the script, whether Danmakufu is pre-packaged, etc.</p>
<img alt="Bulletforge Project Example" height="319" width="532" src="http://i1164.photobucket.com/albums/q570/SparenofIria/ScreenShot2015-01-03at74708PM_zps70f3d459.png" border="0" alt=" photo ScreenShot2015-01-03at74708PM_zps70f3d459.png"/><br><br>
	      <p>Under Images, a list of the uploaded images can be found. Under Video, a video will be displayed if the scripter has chosen to link a video. Under Versions, a list of all versions currently on Bulletforge can be accessed, most recent at the top. On the bottom of all tabs, the comment area can be found. There is a character limit here and scripters are not notified of comments, so it is somewhat unreliable, although it is useful when a script is newly released. You must have a Bulletforge Account to vote or comment.</p>
              <h2 style="color:yellow" id="sub5">Part 5: How Do I Upload My Own Scripts?</h2>
	      <p>In order to upload your scripts, you must first have a Bulletforge account. In the upper right hand corner of the screen, hit New Project and fill in the information. Note that for version, just put the number - the word 'version' will be automatically appended. Fill out the form, and then browse your computer for the archive file.</p>
	      <p>A word of caution: Please read <a href="#sub8">Part 8</a> of this guide before uploading scripts.</p>
	      <p>Remember to hit the "Upload" button!</p>
	      <p>To update your project, you can select Edit Project on the project page. Here you can add Images and Videos, which are shared across all versions. By selecting Edit Version, you can change the properties of a version. You can also add new versions and delete old ones - be aware that download counts and votes for a certain version will be wiped when that version is deleted.</p>
	      <p>Also, note that links are not supported in the description text, so it is best if you include links on a separate line so that it is easy for people to copy them.</p>
              <h2 style="color:yellow" id="sub6">Part 6: How Do I Receive Feedback on My Scripts?</h2>
	      <p>Earlier, I stated that comments are not particularly helpful for feedback purposes. Although it is good when someone pastebins a review and it is good for simple comments, detailed commentary is usually reserved for Let's Plays, Videos on Youtube, and PMs. By including a line in your description that says "Please Rate and Review" or "Please PM me on Maidens of the Kaleidoscope if you have any comments," you can increase the amount of feedback you get.</p>
	      <p>However, there is a catch. When you receive feedback, you are expected to read it and, if possible, implement the suggestions. Feel free to create a new version of a script and upload that to Bulletforge with improvements (as long as you are not in a contest - you cannot post new versions of a script between the contest deadline and the release of the results without permission from the people hosting the contest).</p>
	      <p>As a last note, people will occasionally be harsh and people may troll. Separate the helpful comments from the unhelpful ones, and use that information to improve the quality of your work.</p>
              <h2 style="color:yellow" id="sub7">Part 7: How Do I Advertise My Scripts?</h2>
	      <p>So you have very few downloads, and your project has just slipped off the front page of Bulletforge. How do you keep people downloading your work?</p>
	      <p>At this point, it is up to you. If you are on a forum such as Maidens of the Kaleidoscope, you can post a thread about your projects and describe the virtues of your script (and of course, link to the download). It is generally a good idea to have an eye-catching first image for your project (the first one is the only one that gets displayed in thumbnails on Bulletforge). You can also make a video of your script and post that to Youtube, but if you have few subscribers, you will not get much from this - you will have to build your channel.</p>
	      <p>A slightly more reliable method is to have someone else make a video of your script. Generally speaking, they will not inform you if they have made a video, although some will. You can usually request that someone make a video (they may refuse, of course). However, if you use any of ZUN's music or character sprites/graphics, you may be met with opposition if the video is posted to Niconico with a download link. As a result, if you wish to post a download link and you use ZUN's resources, you should have the video posted to Youtube. Remember ZUN's Copyright guidelines as well. They can be found on the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Touhou_Wiki" title="Official Touhou Project Wiki">Touhou Wiki</a> and Maidens of the Kaleidoscope.</p>
	      <p>If you are making a big project however, you may want to blog, use Facebook or Twitter, or do something large scale such as a website - this will inevitably lead to downloads if given site is well-advertised.</p>
	      <p>Of course, the best way to advertise is to communicate with other members of the Danmakufu community and try out each others' scripts. You never know - you may strike gold!</p>
              <h2 style="color:yellow" id="sub8">Part 8: Unofficial Code of Conduct</h2>
	      <p>FOR ALL USERS:</p>
                <ul>
	          <li>Please do not post spam comments</li>
	          <li>Please do not spam downvotes to demotivate/insult/troll scripters. This is very bad for newer scripters, as they are the most prone to non-constructive criticism and it is easy for them to give up on Danmakufu after getting numerous downvotes, unaware that nobody really cares</li>
	          <li>Please do not use multiple accounts solely for the purposes of up/downvoting. Also do not pretend to be another scripter - we WILL report you and your duplicate account WILL be terminated.</li>
	          <li>Please do not mass-download the same script multiple times to knock up the download count. Someone did this on CURSE01 and some peoples' scripts were inflated by up to 200 illegitimate downloads. It did not cause immediate problems, but it confused a lot of people when they woke up with 200 extra downloads out of nowhere.</li>
	          <li>Please do not insult peoples' work unless there is a legitimate reason for it. Also, do not troll. Your comments are public and we will remember you.</li>
	          <li>If you wish to post a review, it is better to send the person a PM on MotK/Skype/wherever else if possible - we are not notified of comments on our scripts and there is a character limit for the comment box.</li>
	        </ul>
	      <p>FOR SCRIPTERS:</p>
                <ul>
	          <li><strong>Plagiarism is not tolerated by the Danmakufu Community.</strong> Always cite function libraries and code snippets you use, and never use someone else's danmaku, animation systems, backgrounds, or custom systems, etc. without their explicit permission.</li>
	          <li><strong>Please, please, PLEASE test your scripts in a clean copy of Danmakufu before uploading.</strong> <b>Always</b> include shotsheets and players inside the folder of your script. If your script errors on someone else's computer due to a file path error, it is very much your fault, and you will be prompted to fix it by other people who play your script.</li>
	          <li>Please do not upload scripts with .wav for bgm. By throwing an extra 50+ MB onto the download, you are just going to piss people off. Also, Blargel is paying for this, and you are sucking up memory and bandwidth.</li>
	          <li>Always have your script in a folder and then archive the folder. You can screw up someone's computer if you just archive a bunch of files into a .zip or other archive, and people will be pissed when whatever folder they unarchived your archive into explodes with files (oftentimes the desktop, always scattering files everywhere). Danmakufu scripts are meant to be packaged in folders. If you do not know what I am referring to here, look up Tarbombs <a target="_blank" href="http://www.linfo.org/tarbomb.html" title="Information on TARbombs">here</a> or refer to the Wikipedia page <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tar_(computing)#Tarbomb" title="TARbombs on Wikipedia">here</a>. Note that although it is referring to .tar archives, .zip and .rar do the same (A ZIP Bomb is something entirely different) and it is no fun when someone unzips your script into their DNH script folder and a bunch of stuff explodes into their script directory, potentially overriding their system and player folders and screwing up their copy of Danmakufu.</li>
	        </ul>
	      <p>FOR LETS PLAYERS AND VIDEO RECORDERS:</p>
	      <p>(Additional suggestions can be found in <a href="./ph3uXl2.html">Lesson 2 - Youtube</a>)</p>
                <ul>
	          <li>Always cite the download link without the 'v/v1' or whatever version number is used. This will automatically redirect to the latest version of a script. It will save you the pain of having to update the link, and is generally helpful for those trying to get the latest version of a script</li>
	          <li>If the scripter has a information post/thread for their script, please link to that as well.</li>
	          <li>Please make sure you state the name of the script and the person who made it somewhere in the title or description of your video. It'll make the videos easier to find and is generally good practice.</li>
	        </ul>
