Sometimes it may be related to the content of the lesson, but sometimes it may not be. These videos are meant to show the possibilities Danmakufu has to offer. I will also have checkpoints and other things that you may find helpful, such as videos describing certain phenomena and resources for Danmakufu and Computer Programming in general.</p>

	      </div>              <h2 style="color:yellow" id="sub1">Part 1: What is Danmakufu</h2>              <p>It's the question you have all been waiting for, it's that moment in your life, and-</p>
              <p>Oops. This isn't a commercial. I'm sorry.</p>
              <p>Anyways, Touhou Danmakufu is a program for Windows (you can run it on MacOSX and Linux distros using Wine, but it may not work the way you want to) that allows people that are usually referred to as 'danmakufu scripters' to create danmaku patterns similar to those in the Touhou Project games and other shooters. It provides a multitude of built-in functions for you to use, and although it is very limited in terms of what it can be used for, it is nevertheless possible to make Danmakufu do what you want - such as Visual Novels (although seriously, just use Ren'Py if you want to make a VN) or HRtP style games (Highly Responsive to Prayers - the first Touhou game). </p>
              <p>Please note the following:</p>
	      <!--Embedded code below. Whitespace actually matters for this because it is in a pre block-->
              <pre><code>This is code in Danmakufu.</code></pre>
              <p>You make things in Danmakufu by writing code into plain text files (you may want to use .dnh extensions on your files to prevent people from outside the Danmakufu community from accessing them and for text highlighting services). We will get to that eventually.</p>
              <h2 style="color:yellow" id="sub2">Part 2: What is this Tutorial?</h2>
                <p>This tutorial will aim to cover everything from the very basics to moderately advanced concepts in both Danmakufu, Computer Science, and resources in regards to graphical editing and Audacity. I highly suggest doing these tutorials in a relative order - within a unit, do each lesson one at a time, and make sure that you understand the topics covered. In the end, the one who will learn this language is you, and this tutorial is simply one of the many resources meant to assist you in learning basic Danmakufu Ph3.</p>
                <p>But wait! Haven't you already made Danmakufu Tutorials before? Like at <a target="_blank" href="https://sites.google.com/site/sparensdanmakufututorials/">this website?</a></p>
                <p>The answer is yes. However, those tutorials were somewhat... <i>poor quality</i>, and their helpfulness was minimal.</p>
                <p><b>For this tutorial, I assume that you know what Touhou is and what Bombs/Continues/Replays/etc are.</b> If you do not know these things, you may want to visit <a target="_blank" href="https://sites.google.com/site/sparensdanmakufututorials/danmakufu-0-12m-tutorials/002-wat-is-touhou-how-to-play-and-navigate-danmakufu">this page</a> on the aforementioned 0.12m tutorials site. Please note that there are significant differences between 0.12m and ph3, and that ph3 does not baby you by doing all of the background stuff for you - you need to do it yourself in ph3, but at the same time, it is far less limiting and, as stated earlier, you can do nearly <i>anything</i> (within reason) using ph3.</p>
                <p>Please note that on the left menubar, there are two links of great importance. One is a link to the Danmakufu Wiki - please bookmark this, as it is exceptionally helpful. The other is a direct link to the English Documentation which, although incomplete in some areas, should be immensely useful.</p>
              <h2 style="color:yellow" id="sub3">Part 3: What Other Resources can I Use?</h2>
                <p>This is one of a plethora of resources you can use to learn Danmakufu. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.shrinemaiden.org/forum/index.php/board,9.0.html">Rika and Nitori's Garage Experiments</a> on the Maidens of the Kaleidoscope Forums has sticky threads full of useful (although oftentimes outdated) information. Please note that 0.12m and ph3 are quite different, so take caution when using 0.12m code, as it may not port directly into ph3. Please visit <a target="_blank" href="https://www.shrinemaiden.org/forum/index.php/topic,6181.0.html">this thread</a> in order to read on ZUN's fan creation guide and how to use AppLocale (for those who want to run 0.12m and versions of ph3 before ph3[.1 pre2])</p>
                <p>Also note the Sublime Text package for syntax highlighting. Drake and I have been working on this for a while, and this is one of the reasons to use the .dnh format - Sublime Text will recognize this extension if you have installed the package, and will automatically suggest functions, provide partial documentation, and more. Sublime's free trial lasts forever (as far as I know), so please do use it.</p>
                <p>Of course, the Danmakufu Wiki not only has functions and the like - it also contains links to other tutorials and guides, which I will refer to and link to very often in this tutorial, as my style may not always be the most helpful for some learners. You should be able to find this on your own - if you can't, you'll eventually find it. (the same logic applies to errors - you need to be able to find them on your own sometimes, and you will usually facepalm/facedesk/facecomputer (please don't do this), or do something else when you realize how stupid the error was).</p>
                <p>A final note is about <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bulletforge.org">Bulletforge</a>. This is a site where you can upload your scripts for the entire world to see. Just be aware of a few things:</p>
                <ul>
	          <li>Plagiarism is <b>not tolerated</b>. Do <b>not</b> use code without permission and citation unless the creator of such code has given explicit permission.</li>
	          <li>Feedback. People will sometimes leave comments. Read them - they may help you. Constructive criticism is one of the best things you can get.</li>
	          <li>On that same note, there are also trolls. Ignore all downvotes.</li>
	          <li>Before uploading to Bulletforge, have someone else test your script and make sure it works, especially if you're submitting something for a contest.</li>
	          <li>Download awesome scripts - the code may be a mess, but if you can understand how someone's code works, then that will give you a better understanding of how to make your own patterns.</li>
	          <li>Play those awesome scripts you have downloaded and give feedback! This is a community, and being a part of it has rewards including but not limited to:</li>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Free Code and Libraries</li>
                      <li>Sprites and Graphics</li>
                      <li>Sound Resources</li>
                      <li>Fame, Prestige, and Glory</li>
                      <li>Friends! Or Enemies. You choose.</li>
                    </ul>
