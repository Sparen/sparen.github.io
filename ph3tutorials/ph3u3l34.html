	      <h2 class="ph3tutorialheader" id="sub1">Part 1: What will be covered in this lesson?</h2>
	      <p>Welcome to the introductory player script guide! In this guide, we will cover the fundamental components of a player script and how you can create your own. We will utilize the default ExRumia as an example of a player script, but will take a different approach from usual in this guide and will have you start from scratch - a complete blank slate. Accordingly, we will provide some basic graphics that you can use as a starting point.</p>
	      <p>Player scripts are incredibly complex in that creating them requires a working knowledge of most of the provided object types in Danmakufu. It is the only cross-cutting script of this sort and as such, we recommend that you be familiar with the following prior to starting: Shot Objects, 2D Sprite Objects, Primitive Objects, Text Objects, Sound Objects, Shotsheets, Events, and Virtual Keys</p>
	      <p>In order to not overload this guide, a discussion on player design and balancing as well as how *not* to design a shottype will be provided in the next guide, which will be shorter but far more complex in content.</p>
	      <h2 class="ph3tutorialheader" id="sub2">Part 2: What are the components of a player script?</h2>
	      <p>Before we start writing a player script, we must first understand the components that make up a player. </p>
	      <p>So let's start at the very beginning? What exactly is a player? What are the most fundamental traits that make a player, well, a player?</p>
	      <p>The first is that it acts as a means for the physical player to interact with the game. It doesn't really matter what the player looks like or sounds like - all that matters is that the physical player be able to provide instructions, and that the player script execute those instructions. In Touhou games, these are commands such as the movement commands, firing, and casting a spell card/bomb. All of these are mapped to virtual keys, which in turn control the player.</p>
	      <p>Therefore, virtual keys are what control the player in-game. For a refresher on virtual keys and key input, see <a href="./ph3u3l32.html">Lesson 32</a>.</p>
	      <p>Now, in Touhou style games, the player can do a number of different actions, and can be customized in a variety of different ways. We will split these up into six sections.</p>
	      <p>First, the basic parameters of the player. Every player has its own speed, graze radius, deathbomb window, etc. In addition, you must render the player in order for the physical player to understand how the player is reacting to their input.</p>
	      <p>Next is a common aspect of Touhou-style players - the Player Option. Options/Shikigami/Familiars accompany the player and are typically tasked with moving in a specific way and firing shots. These must be rendered, controlled depending on whether the player is moving unfocused or focused, and must fire shots accordingly.</p>
	      <p>In addition, we have player death. Player death is simple on the surface, but is actually quite a bit more complex. For example, where does the player respawn? How do graphics and familiars adjust to that respawn point? How is deathbombing controlled? Is it controlled automatically? And after the player has respawned, how do you convey to the player that the player is no longer invincible? These are all things that need to be taken into consideration.</p>
	      <p>Another component is the player event. Just like any other Danmakufu script, players have an event handler, and can work with a variety of system-triggered events. We will go into more detail in the respective section, but there is much customization that can be done here, in addition to noting some aspects that Danmakufu does not handle by default.</p>
	      <p>In addition to these, players have their own shotsheets and control mechanisms when they are firing. How do these work? How do you handle focused vs. unfocused shottypes?</p>
	      <p>And finally, player bombs are incredibly complex, with their own special object type. From triggering to rendering and action to completion, it is necessary to understand how they work, how they destroy bullets, and how to avoid unfortunate accidents.</p>
	      <p>With that introduction out of the way, let's get started.</p>
	      <h2 class="ph3tutorialheader" id="sub3">Part 3: How do I create the structure of a player script?</h2>
	      <p>As noted earlier, we will be working from scratch here instead of starting by analyzing the default player script. We will go section by section, but let's start with our general framework.</p>
