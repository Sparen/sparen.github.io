	      </div>              <h2 style="color:yellow" id="sub1">Part 1: What will be Covered in this Lesson?</h2>
	      <p>With such an ambiguous lesson title, you are probably wondering what I will be covering in this lesson. Put simply, I will introduce shotsheets as well as blend types, and will be explaining in detail the properties of bullets, including many of the ObjMove and ObjRender functions for bullets.</p>
	      <p>Although seemingly disjoint from the rest of the tutorials, I will be providing basic information on graphics in Danmakufu, and will also explain how I (and quite a few other) danmakufu scripters choose to load our shotsheets.</p>
              <h2 style="color:yellow" id="sub2">Part 2: What are Shotsheets and Shot Constant Sheets?</h2>
	      <p>By now, you should be familiar with the presence of <code>#include"script/default_system/Default_ShotConst.txt"</code> at the top of our Single scripts. If you remove this while firing shots in the script, you will get errors stating that some final constant in all caps has not been defined. Here I will provide a brief explanation for how this works, as well as shotsheets themselves.</p>
	      <p>In Touhou Danmakufu 0.12m, there were these things called 'shot replace' images that would override the default shotsheets, or you could use your own shotsheet. However, ph3 came along, and shot replace images are now outdated and there is no reason to use them. If you do in fact do a shot replace by replacing the image in the default system, that's perfectly fine - you just can't force someone else to do the same because you are overriding the defaults. And in fact, there is no need to because shotsheets in ph3 are significantly better than in 0.12m and should be used regardless.</p>
	      <p>First we will observe the Default_ShotConst.txt file in the default system, which is a shot constant file we have included. An include basically takes the contents of the included file and spills them into the script calling #include,  specifically at the place where the #include was. If we look inside this file, it states a path to Default_ShotData.txt and then loads the enemy shot data using <code>LoadEnemyShotData()</code>. This is how to load a shotsheet in a script. After this, a large number of final constants is declared, each referring to a number. So, what are those numbers? Well, we will discuss them in the next part when we discuss shot graphic IDs.</p>
	      <p>At this point, I would like to state something in regards to my scripts and those of some others who do not use a shot constant sheet. I personally remove the include statement to the shot constant file in a script. Why? I instead load the shotsheet (remember LoadEnemyShotData?), and then use the individual IDs. There is little to no benefit to doing this - it is a matter of style. However, most shot constant sheets do not account for every bullet ID, and those using shot constant sheets may never use certain bullet graphics because no final constant exists for those particular bullet ids. You can still refer to the bullets by number as well as by their final constant names, but most scripters do not mix and match final constants and numbers for shot graphics, instead sticking to one or the other. It's up to you whether to keep the shot constant sheet or not - the benefit is that if you change shotsheets while a script is under development, it is possible that the constant names will be the same and you will not have to change any of the graphic parameters in your script to change the graphic ids to the ones in the new shotsheet.</p>
	      <p>The file we will now observe is Default_ShotData.txt in the default system. Inside this file is something that looks absolutely obscure. What is going on here? No semicolons? Huh? This is a shotsheet. To begin a shotsheet, <code>#UserShotData</code> is used, and shot_image points to the path of the image file containing the bullet graphics. <strong>shot_image is NOT a variable.</strong> delay_rect is the part of the image that contains the delay cloud for the bullet.</p>
	      <p>Of particular note are the four parameters for delay_rect. They are left, top, right, and bottom, and refer to the pixels on the image file, and this left--top-right-bottom (LTRB) system is followed throughout all of Danmakufu. The numbers form a rectangle around the graphic, and 0 refers to the left or top of the image for x values (left, right) and y values (top, bottom) respectively. Please keep in mind that for top and right, the pixels that will be taken include one pixel to the top and right of the pixels represented by the numbers. It's annoying, but deal with it. Later on, when discussing ADD blending, I will briefly talk about white line syndrome, which is an unwanted side effect of this. !!!FACT CHECKERS PLEASE MAKE SURE THAT I GOT THIS RIGHT!!!</p>
	      <p>Now we will discuss the properties that can be assigned to shots in a shotsheet.</p>
              <h2 style="color:yellow" id="sub3">Part 3: What are the Properties of a Shot in a Shotsheet?</h2>
	      <p>Inside ShotData{} are a number of properties that can be assigned to shots. Of particular note are id, rect, and delay_color, which are required for proper functioning of the shot</p>
	      <p>id is the number that distinguishes the bullet graphic. It is what is referenced by the graphic parameter of most shot creation functions, and is also referenced in the shot constant sheet. It should be unique for the bullet.</p>
	      <p>rect, like in the delay_rect, determines the location of the shot on the image referenced in shot_image and controls what the shot will look like.</p>
	      <p>Finally, delay_color is the color of the delay graphic, taken in (R, G, B) format.</p>
	      <p>Besides the three properties listed above, you can also use render, angular_velocity, fixed_angle, and collision. You can also have Animation Data for animated shots, although this will not be discussed in this tutorial.</p>
	      <p>If you want to make your own shotsheets, please see my <a target="_blank" href="http://dmf.shrinemaiden.org/wiki/Sparen's_0.12m_to_ph3_Transition_Guide#ShotSheets" title="Sparen's 0.12m to ph3 Transition Guide - Shotsheets (Danmakufu Wiki)">0.12m to ph3 Transition Guide</a>, where I have provided some more detailed information on shotsheets.</p>
	      <p>Now to discuss the other properties. Firstly, render. This sets the Blend Type. The default is <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_compositing" title="Alpha Blending on Wikipedia">ALPHA</a>, which renders the graphic as-is, including transparency from the Alpha channel. You can also do <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blend_modes#Addition" title="Add Blending on Wikipedia">ADD and ADD_ARGB</a>, which makes the bullet shiny. ADD requires a black background to make things shiny - otherwise it looks hideous. ADD_ARGB is based on the Alpha channel instead, and makes partially transparent bullets shiny. You can also use Subtractive and Multiplicative blends with SUBTRACT and MULTIPLY, but these are not usually used. Most of the time, you will use a function that will be discussed later, <code>ObjRender_SetBlendType()</code>, to change the render type of the graphic, and shotsheets therefore tend to contain only ALPHA and either ADD or ADD_ARGB shots. If render is not filled out, it defaults to ALPHA.</p>
	      <p>Next is angular_velocity. This controls the rotation of the bullet graphic. Default is 0, for no rotation.</p>
	      <p>Next is fixed_angle, which takes a boolean. True means that the bullet will always take the shape in the shotsheet and will never rotate. Default is false.</p>
	      <p>Finally, we have collision, which is the hitbox. By default, the hitbox is a percentage of the bullet graphic (in a circle), but by setting a value to collision (in pixels), you can specify a different radius for the hitbox, which originates from the center of the LTRB rectangle.</p>
	      <p>With that out of the way, let's begin our discussion on actual shots and their properties.</p>
