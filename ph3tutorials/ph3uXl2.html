              <p>This is a guide to getting your projects advertised on Youtube, as well as a compilation of people who routinely make videos of Danmakufu scripts, by Sparen of Iria. It is meant for those with channels featuring Danmakufu, Danmakufu scripters, as well as those who want to find other Danmakufu scripters on Youtube. This guide does not cover Niconico, which is the primary means of showcasing Danmakufu videos in Japan.</p>

	      </div>              <h2 style="color:yellow" id="sub1">For Scripters</h2>
	      <p>So you want to promote your scripts, right? And you feel that having a video of your script on Youtube is an amazing way to do that, right? Well, it is, and being able to link a video in Bulletforge for your project is also great. However, there are a few things to note.</p>
	      <p>Of course, you could make the video yourself. However, if you have 0 subscribers, you will obviously need to increase this number while at the same time avoiding <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLJQ0gFHM8s&spfreload=10" title="Game Theory on Subscriber Burn (Youtube)">subscriber burn</a>. To increase your views and subs, you will have to link your own videos on Bulletforge, post video links on your release website/thread, and will need to spend a year at the very least to get a respectable view count for your projects. The good thing about this method? You are <b>100%</b> in control of what you show and how you show it. The bad part? Well, you have to build your own Youtube channel up yourself.</p>
	      <p>The other option is to have someone else make a video for you. There are a few types of people who do this (all of whom will be listed later on). There are Lets Players, who will often do commentary on a blind run of your script, for example. This is a risky prospect for new scripters because although most lets players will offer detailed feedback and constructive criticism, most, if not all, of the flaws in your script will be made apparent to all who watch the video.</p>
	      <p>Of course, there are also those who just make a video. Since there is no commentary, the viewers will be the ones making their own judgments about your script. While safer as an option, it still has its ups and downs.</p>
	      <p>Some people take requests and others will just play whatever comes up on Bulletforge. Some may reject your requests. Remember this, and consider doing a combination of both making your own videos and having others make them as well. And, perhaps... you will make videos of other peoples' scripts as well!</p>
              <h2 style="color:yellow" id="sub2">For Uploaders</h2>
	      <p>I believe that at the time of writing, this is the only guide meant to set minimum standards for the video recorders of the English-Speaking Danmakufu Community. I will be discussing a number of things that serve as common courtesy when making videos of Danmakufu scripts.</p>
	      <p>First, it goes without saying - you must state who made the script. You are doing a disservice to the person who made the script if you do not state who made it.</p>
	      <p>Secondly, I beg you, PLEASE post a link to the scripter's devel thread and/or a link to the download link on Bulletforge. If you do not do this, your viewers will not be able to learn more about the script and may not be able to find it. On this note, respect the scripter's requests if they do not want you to show the download link. As for link formatting, always cite Bulletforge download links without the 'v/v1' or whatever version number is used. This will automatically redirect to the latest version of a script. It will save you the pain of having to update the link, and is generally helpful for those trying to get the latest version of a script. Also, make sure your download is legitimate and, if not hosted on Bulletforge, the latest version of the script.</p>
	      <p>Thirdly, please get the name of the script right. You know who you are, and although people will not usually care, it's a good idea to get this correct.</p>
	      <p>Optionally, it is usually a good idea to state the difficulty you played and the version number, usually in the description.</p>
              <h1 style="color:orange" id="sub3">Compilation of Danmakufu uploaders on Youtube</h1>
	      <p>To get onto this list, you must have a few uploaded videos, and you must pass through a screening. Unless otherwise stated, the people listed do not do lets plays by default. This list is not comprehensive and should not be treated as such, although I will try to keep it updated and accurate. This list is primarily meant to showcase those who do videos of other peoples's scripts. Note that some of the people here have not uploaded videos in a while and may not be particularly active.</p>

	      <p>AKA: Ozzie840, Ozzy</p>
	      <p>Although not very active, he provides very good feedback on scripts in his Lets Plays, and he's a nice guy. Also, the IT'S THREEEE DEEEEEEEE meme spawned from his playthrough of Byzantheryx's Koishi.</p>

              <h3 style="color:aqua">Jan Aldryn Bio</h3>

              <div class="g-ytsubscribe" data-channel="kirbio123" data-layout="full" data-theme="dark" data-count="default"></div><br><br>

	      <p>Usually only posts videos of his own scripts, although he may do a video of yours if you ask.</p>
              <h3 style="color:aqua">Miransu Uwabami</h3>
              <div class="g-ytsubscribe" data-channel="uwabamimi" data-layout="full" data-theme="dark" data-count="default"></div><br><br>
	      <p>AKA: Mewkyuu, Victini, Byzantheryx</p>
	      <p>Does Let's Plays, and although harsh with his feedback, gives some good advice. Has been scripting for many years.</p>

              <div class="g-ytsubscribe" data-channel="muelnw" data-layout="full" data-theme="dark" data-count="default"></div><br><br>
	      <p>One of the absolute best ph3 scripters. Does not post often, but always produces high-quality and beautiful work. Sometimes showcases other peoples's scripts.</p>
              <h2 style="color:yellow">Those who only upload videos of their own scripts</h2>
              <h3 style="color:aqua">AJS</h3>
              <div class="g-ytsubscribe" data-channel="zappazoey" data-layout="full" data-theme="dark" data-count="default"></div><br><br>
	      <p>Despite having relatively few videos, he has a TREMENDOUS following and produces a plethora of high quality scripts (often featuring Yukari). His videos do not disappoint and nor do his scripts. POWERBULLET!</p>

	      <p>AKA: Bob the Tanuki</p>
	      <p>As of writing, still uses 0.12m exclusively, but produces good stuff.</p>
