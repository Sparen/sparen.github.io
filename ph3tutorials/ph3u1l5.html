              <h2 style="color:yellow" id="sub2">Part 2: What are Booleans?</h2>
              <p>A boolean is, simply put, either true or false.</p>
                <pre><code>let bool = true;
let bool2 = false;</code></pre>
              <p>Simple, right? Now we will discuss boolean expressions, which are expressions that are either true or false and will be very useful when we discuss if and if-else statements in Part 3.</p>
                <pre><code>let test = (5>6); //false, since 5 is not greater than 6
let test2 = (4 == 6); //False because 4 is not equal to 6.
let test3 = (1<=3); //true because 1 is less than or equal to 3.
let test4 = (6 != 3); //true because 6 is not equal to 3.</code></pre>
              <p>The first thing to note is the double equal sign ==. This is used for logic in Danmakufu in place of the single equal sign =, which is used for setting values to variables and constants. The next thing to note is the use of the !, which functions as 'not' and is used in negation. Please note that characters, strings, and booleans obviously cannot use things such as < (less than) or >= (greater than or equal to) for obvious reasons. You can only test for equality and inequality for these.</p>
              <p>Now we will discuss boolean expressions involving multiple booleans.</p>
              <p>Behold: || and &&</p>
                <pre><code>let bool = true;
let bool2 = false;
let test = (bool || bool2); //test is true if either bool OR bool2 is true, else false
let test2 = (bool && bool2); //test2 is true if bool AND bool2 are true, else false
let test3 = (bool || !bool2); //test3 is true if bool OR not bool2 is true. IE if bool2 is false.</code></pre>
              <p>As seen above, || denotes OR and && denotes AND. When we discuss if and if-else statements in the next part, we will be returning to this, as it is the foundation of script control and flow in danmakufu.</p>
              <p>To close, be aware that the boolean true = 1 and the boolean false = 0. This is good to know for general Computer Science, and it can be manipulated for various purposes.</p>
              <h2 style="color:yellow" id="sub3">Part 3: What are If and If-Else Statements?</h2>
              <p>So now we have all this knowledge of booleans and boolean expressions. So what will we do with it? Well, if you want to only execute certain code under certain conditions, you can use booleans and boolean expressions in if, if-else, and alternative-case statements!</p>
                <pre><code>if(count>30){count==0;}</code></pre>
              <p>Above is an example of an if statement. If statements have a condition, which is a boolean or boolean expression, and if that expression is true, the code in the braces following the statement will be executed. In the above situation, the variable count will be set to 0 if its value is greater than 30. If its value is not greater than 30, the code within the braces will not be executed.</p>
              <p>If you want to do something else instead, you can use if-else statements.</p>
                <pre><code>if(count>30){count=0;}else{count++;}</code></pre>
              <p>Now, if the count is not greater than 30, it will increment by 1! You can also nest if else statements and have multiple else statements.</p>
                <pre><code>if(count>30){
	count=0;
}else if(count<0){
	count=0;
}else{
	count++;
	if(count%3==0){
	  //Do something
	}
}</code></pre>
              <p>In the above example, there is another case - if count is less than 0. In this manner, you can set the code to do a variety of things. In the last part, the case where count greater than or equal to 0 AND less than or equal to 30, there is also another if statement allowing the code to do yet another thing.</p>
              <p>However, if you have a lot of different cases using the same variable, a wall of if else statements gets clunky and hard to read. As a result, there are switch statements, known as alternative-case statements in Danmakufu. They are basically shorthand for if-else statements.</p>
              <p>But wait! Haven't we seen these before in @Event? Why yes. That's one of the places where you will be using them.</p>
                <pre><code>    alternative(x)
    case(-3){
	//Do stuff
    }
    case(2){
	//Do other stuff
    }
    case(10){
	//Do some stuff
    }
    others{
	//Do various stuff
    }</code></pre>
              <p>The way an alternative-case statement works is as follows: The variable inside alternative() is the variable that is being tested. The first case asks whether x == -3. If true, it will execute the stuff inside the braces for case(-3) and ignore everything else. If x is not -3, it will move on to the next case and so on. Finally, if it has exhausted its options, it will do whatever is in others{} or, if others{} is not there, simply exit the statement and do nothing. Very helpful.</p>
              <h2 style="color:yellow" id="sub4">Part 4: What are Loops and How do I Use Them?</h2>
              <p>So you want to repeatedly do something without having to state it again? Well, loops are the solution to those problems! There are a few types of loops in Danmakufu.</p>
              <p>The first type of loop is the generic loop. It is a structure that takes a parameter and will run code multiple times. The parameter must be an integer because it you can't repeat something 3.5 times. An example is probably the best way to show this.</p>
                <pre><code>let x = 5;
loop(20){
    x++;
}</code></pre>
              <p>Let's discuss the above code. First, we declare the variable x, which is then assigned the numerical value 5. After this, x+= is called in a loop(20). What the loop does is repeat the code contained within the {} the number of times given in the parenthesis. Therefore, x will equal 25 after this code has been executed. If you had a variable x, you could also loop(x), which would loop the code in the following braces x time. </p>
              <p>Now is a good time to talk about infinite loops. I.E. how to freeze Danmakufu. An infinite loop occurs when a section of code keeps on looping forever, and the only way to stop it is to terminate the program altogether. Later on in this lesson, we will discuss yield; (the best way to make an infinite loop not actually infinite but achieve similar functions until the script terminates), but as a brief note, loop alone or with nothing in the parenthesis (e.g. <code>loop(){blah;}</code> will trigger infinite loops and using them should be avoided until knowledge of yield; is sufficient.</p>
              <p>Next are while loops. Basically, while a certain condition is true (booleans!), the code in the braces after it will be executed, just like an if statement except automatically repeated.</p>
                <pre><code>let x = 5;
while(x<20){
    x++;
}</code></pre>
              <p>In the code above, we declare x and then run a while loop where, while x is less than 20, x is incremented by 1. The code in question will loop itself and x will be 20 after the code has executed.</p>
                <pre><code>let x = 5;
while(x>20){
    x++;
}</code></pre>
              <p>In the above scenario, x is less than 20, so the condition for the while loop is never fulfilled. Therefore, the while loop never executes and x is left as 5 afterwards.</p>
                <pre><code>let x = 5;
while(x>0){
    x++;
}</code></pre>
              <p>To close our study of the while loop, we will consider the above code, where x is declared to be 5 and while x>0, x increments by 1. As is easily observable, x will never actually become less than 0. Therefore, this code will cause an infinite loop and Danmakufu will freeze.</p>
              <p>Now we will discuss the last type of loop in Danmakufu - the for loop. In Danmakufu, the for loop comes in two varieties, ascent and descent.</p>
              <p>For a video tutorial, please consult the following: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0jBPs90KTg&list=PLJ2F_5rhjlXTwCoPy9-5JSOufqAou908K">Sparen's Danmakufu Tutorials - Using Ascent Loops and More</a>. However, please be aware that this tutorial assumes prior knowledge of bullet spawning functions.</p>
              <p>A generic ascent loop is structured as follows:</p>
                <pre><code>let x = 5;
ascent(i in 0..8){
    x++;
}</code></pre>
              <p>What this code does is actually a little hard to understand. You can think of it like this: a local variable called i, with a variable 0, is declared. After this, the block of code inside the braces {} is executed. After that, i is incremented by 1 as long as it is less than 8. If it is less than 8 after having been incremented, the code loops again. Once the variable i is equal to 8, the loop ends. This means that i will never actually equal 8 in a run through the loop.</p>
                <pre><code>let x = 5;
ascent(i in 0..8){
    x=i;
}</code></pre>
              <p>If you do the above, x will start at 0, but it will be set to the value of i, which is 0. As the loop continues, x will be set to 1, 2, 3, and eventually, 7. After it is set to 7, the local variable i is set to 8, and the loop ends, leaving x as 7. In total, the code loops 8 times, and i has values from 0 to 7.</p>
              <p>Drake once wrote the following equivalent code for an ascent loop:</p>
                <pre><code>ascent(var in 0..10){
    bla(var);
}

//Above is equivalent to below

local{
    let var = 0;
    while(var<10){
        bla(var);
        var++;
    }
}</code></pre>
              <p>Please note that by convention, the values used in ascent/descent/for loops go as follows: i, j, k, l, etc. Regarding descent loops, the local variable decrements instead of incrementing. You will need descent loops for certain things but you will be using ascent loops most of the time.</p>
              <p>If you don't understand ascent loops, that's perfectly fine - they're harder to understand than some of the other things in Danmakufu.</p>
              <p>Finally, on an important note, please remember break; - this will break you out of the innermost loop. The loop will execute all code from break; to the closing brace, and will then exit. This has a variety of uses, which will be useful later on.</p>
